\TeX\ is a typesetting language \cite{kim2002performance}. Instead of visually formatting your text, you type
your text combined with commands in a plain text file. 

You can use macro packages like \LaTeX.
TeX is a superb typesetter and is therefore very good at formulas: \[\Omega_0 = \left (\frac{\alpha}{\beta} \right ) ^ 4\]
