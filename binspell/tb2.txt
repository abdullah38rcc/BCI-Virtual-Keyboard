Preface

This text is intended for a one- or two-semester undergraduate course in abstract algebra. Traditionally, these courses have covered the theoretical aspects of groups, rings, and ﬁelds. However, with the development of computing in the last several decades, applications that involve abstract algebra and discrete mathematics have become increasingly important, and many science, engineering, and computer science students are now electing to minor in mathematics. Though theory still occupies a central role in the subject of abstract algebra and no student should go through such a course without a good notion of what a proof is, the importance of applications such as coding theory and cryptography has grown signiﬁcantly. Until recently most abstract algebra texts included few if any applications. However, one of the major problems in teaching an abstract algebra course is that for many students it is their ﬁrst encounter with an environment that requires them to do rigorous proofs. Such students often ﬁnd it hard to see the use of learning to prove theorems and propositions; applied examples help the instructor provide motivation. This text contains more material than can possibly be covered in a single semester. Certainly there is adequate material for a two-semester course, and perhaps more; however, for a one-semester course it would be quite easy to omit selected chapters and still have a useful text. The order of presentation of topics is standard: groups, then rings, and ﬁnally ﬁelds. Emphasis can be placed either on theory or on applications. A typical one-semester course might cover groups and rings while brieﬂy touching on ﬁeld theory, using Chapters 0 through 5, 8, 9, 11 (the ﬁrst part), 14, 15, 16 (the ﬁrst part), 18, and 19. Parts of these chapters could be deleted and applications substituted according to the interests of the students and the instructor. A two-semester course emphasizing theory might cover Chapters 0 through 5, 8, 9, 11 through 16, 18, 19, 20 (the ﬁrst part), and 21. On the other hand, vii

if applications are to be emphasized, the course might cover Chapters 0 through 12, and 14 through 20. In an applied course, some of the more theoretical results could be assumed or omitted. A chapter dependency chart appears below. (A broken line indicates a partial dependency.)

Though there are no speciﬁc prerequisites for a course in abstract algebra, students who have had other higher-level courses in mathematics will generally be more prepared than those who have not, because they will possess a bit more mathematical sophistication. Occasionally, we shall assume some basic linear algebra; that is, we shall take for granted an elementary knowledge of matrices and determinants. This should present no great problem, since most students taking a course in abstract algebra have been introduced to matrices and determinants elsewhere in their career, if they have not already taken a sophomore- or junior-level course in linear algebra. Exercise sections are the heart of any mathematics text. An exercise set

appears at the end of each chapter. The nature of the exercises ranges over several categories; computational, conceptual, and theoretical problems are included. A section presenting hints and solutions to many of the exercises appears at the end of the text. Often in the solutions a proof is only sketched, and it is up to the student to provide the details. The exercises range in diﬃculty from very easy to very challenging. Many of the more substantial problems require careful thought, so the student should not be discouraged if the solution is not forthcoming after a few minutes of work. A complete solutions manual is available for the instructor’s use. There are additional exercises or computer projects at the ends of many of the chapters. The computer projects usually require a knowledge of programming. All of these exercises and projects are more substantial in nature and allow the exploration of new results and theory.

Preliminaries

A certain amount of mathematical maturity is necessary to ﬁnd and study applications of abstract algebra. A basic knowledge of set theory, mathematical induction, equivalence relations, and matrices is a must. Even more important is the ability to read and understand mathematical proofs. In this chapter we will outline the background needed for a course in abstract algebra.

0.1

A Short Note on Proofs

Abstract mathematics is diﬀerent from other sciences. In laboratory sciences such as chemistry and physics, scientists perform experiments to discover new principles and verify theories. Although mathematics is often motivated by physical experimentation or by computer simulations, it is made rigorous through the use of logical arguments. In studying abstract mathematics, we take what is called an axiomatic approach; that is, we take a collection of objects S and assume some rules about their structure. These rules are called axioms. Using the axioms for S, we wish to derive other information about S by using logical arguments. We require that our axioms be consistent; that is, they should not contradict one another. We also demand that there not be too many axioms. If a system of axioms is too restrictive, there will be few examples of the mathematical structure. A statement in logic or mathematics is an assertion that is either true or false. Consider the following examples: • 3 + 56 − 13 + 8/2. • All cats are black. • 2 + 3 = 5. 1

2 • 2x = 6 exactly when x = 4.

CHAPTER 0

PRELIMINARIES

• If ax2 + bx + c = 0 and a = 0, then √ −b ± b2 − 4ac x= . 2a • x3 − 4x2 + 5x − 6. All but the ﬁrst and last examples are statements, and must be either true or false. A mathematical proof is nothing more than a convincing argument about the accuracy of a statement. Such an argument should contain enough detail to convince the audience; for instance, we can see that the statement “2x = 6 exactly when x = 4” is false by evaluating 2 · 4 and noting that 6 = 8, an argument that would satisfy anyone. Of course, audiences may vary widely: proofs can be addressed to another student, to a professor, or to the reader of a text. If more detail than needed is presented in the proof, then the explanation will be either long-winded or poorly written. If too much detail is omitted, then the proof may not be convincing. Again it is important to keep the audience in mind. High school students require much more detail than do graduate students. A good rule of thumb for an argument in an introductory abstract algebra course is that it should be written to convince one’s peers, whether those peers be other students or other readers of the text. Let us examine diﬀerent types of statements. A statement could be as simple as “10/5 = 2”; however, mathematicians are usually interested in more complex statements such as “If p, then q,” where p and q are both statements. If certain statements are known or assumed to be true, we wish to know what we can say about other statements. Here p is called the hypothesis and q is known as the conclusion. Consider the following statement: If ax2 + bx + c = 0 and a = 0, then √ −b ± b2 − 4ac x= . 2a The hypothesis is ax2 + bx + c = 0 and a = 0; the conclusion is √ −b ± b2 − 4ac x= . 2a Notice that the statement says nothing about whether or not the hypothesis is true. However, if this entire statement is true and we can show that

0.1

ax2 + bx + c = 0 with a = 0 is true, then the conclusion must be true. A proof of this statement might simply be a series of equations: ax2 + bx + c = 0 b c x2 + x = − a a b b 2 b x2 + x + = a 2a 2a x+ b 2a

If we can prove a statement true, then that statement is called a proposition. A proposition of major importance is called a theorem. Sometimes instead of proving a theorem or proposition all at once, we break the proof down into modules; that is, we prove several supporting propositions, which are called lemmas, and use the results of these propositions to prove the main result. If we can prove a proposition or a theorem, we will often, with very little eﬀort, be able to derive other related propositions called corollaries.

Some Cautions and Suggestions
There are several diﬀerent strategies for proving propositions. In addition to using diﬀerent methods of proof, students often make some common mistakes when they are ﬁrst learning how to prove theorems. To aid students who are studying abstract mathematics for the ﬁrst time, we list here some of the diﬃculties that they may encounter and some of the strategies of proof available to them. It is a good idea to keep referring back to this list as a reminder. (Other techniques of proof will become apparent throughout this chapter and the remainder of the text.) • A theorem cannot be proved by example; however, the standard way to show that a statement is not a theorem is to provide a counterexample. • Quantiﬁers are important. Words and phrases such as only, for all, for every, and for some possess diﬀerent meanings.

CHAPTER 0

PRELIMINARIES

• Never assume any hypothesis that is not explicitly stated in the theorem. You cannot take things for granted. • Suppose you wish to show that an object exists and is unique. First show that there actually is such an object. To show that it is unique, assume that there are two such objects, say r and s, and then show that r = s. • Sometimes it is easier to prove the contrapositive of a statement. Proving the statement “If p, then q” is exactly the same as proving the statement “If not q, then not p.” • Although it is usually better to ﬁnd a direct proof of a theorem, this task can sometimes be diﬃcult. It may be easier to assume that the theorem that you are trying to prove is false, and to hope that in the course of your argument you are forced to make some statement that cannot possibly be true. Remember that one of the main objectives of higher mathematics is proving theorems. Theorems are tools that make new and productive applications of mathematics possible. We use examples to give insight into existing theorems and to foster intuitions as to what new theorems might be true. Applications, examples, and proofs are tightly interconnected— much more so than they may seem at ﬁrst appearance.

Sets and Equivalence Relations

Set Theory
A set is a well-deﬁned collection of objects; that is, it is deﬁned in such a manner that we can determine for any given object x whether or not x belongs to the set. The objects that belong to a set are called its elements or members. We will denote sets by capital letters, such as A or X; if a is an element of the set A, we write a ∈ A. A set is usually speciﬁed either by listing all of its elements inside a pair of braces or by stating the property that determines whether or not an object x belongs to the set. We might write X = {x1 , x2 , . . . , xn } for a set containing elements x1 , x2 , . . . , xn or X = {x : x satisﬁes P}

0.2

SETS AND EQUIVALENCE RELATIONS

if each x in X satisﬁes a certain property P. For example, if E is the set of even positive integers, we can describe E by writing either E = {2, 4, 6, . . .} or E = {x : x is an even integer and x > 0}. We write 2 ∈ E when we want to say that 2 is in the set E, and −3 ∈ E to / say that −3 is not in the set E. Some of the more important sets that we will consider are the following: N = {n : n is a natural number} = {1, 2, 3, . . .}; Z = {n : n is an integer} = {. . . , −1, 0, 1, 2, . . .}; Q = {r : r is a rational number} = {p/q : p, q ∈ Z where q = 0}; R = {x : x is a real number}; C = {z : z is a complex number}. We ﬁnd various relations between sets and can perform operations on sets. A set A is a subset of B, written A ⊂ B or B ⊃ A, if every element of A is also an element of B. For example, {4, 5, 8} ⊂ {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} and N ⊂ Z ⊂ Q ⊂ R ⊂ C. Trivially, every set is a subset of itself. A set B is a proper subset of a set A if B ⊂ A but B = A. If A is not a subset of B, we write A ⊂ B; for example, {4, 7, 9} ⊂ {2, 4, 5, 8, 9}. Two sets are equal, written A = B, if we can show that A ⊂ B and B ⊂ A. It is convenient to have a set with no elements in it. This set is called the empty set and is denoted by ∅. Note that the empty set is a subset of every set. To construct new sets out of old sets, we can perform certain operations: the union A ∪ B of two sets A and B is deﬁned as A ∪ B = {x : x ∈ A or x ∈ B}; the intersection of A and B is deﬁned by A ∩ B = {x : x ∈ A and x ∈ B}.

6 If A = {1, 3, 5} and B = {1, 2, 3, 9}, then

CHAPTER 0

PRELIMINARIES

A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 5, 9} and A ∩ B = {1, 3}. We can consider the union and the intersection of more than two sets. In this case we write

Ai = A1 ∪ . . . ∪ An

and

n

Ai = A1 ∩ . . . ∩ An
i=1

for the union and intersection, respectively, of the collection of sets A1 , . . . An . When two sets have no elements in common, they are said to be disjoint; for example, if E is the set of even integers and O is the set of odd integers, then E and O are disjoint. Two sets A and B are disjoint exactly when A ∩ B = ∅. Sometimes we will work within one ﬁxed set U , called the universal set. For any set A ⊂ U , we deﬁne the complement of A, denoted by A , to be the set A = {x : x ∈ U and x ∈ A}. / We deﬁne the diﬀerence of two sets A and B to be A \ B = A ∩ B = {x : x ∈ A and x ∈ B}. / Example 1. Let R be the universal set and suppose that A = {x ∈ R : 0 < x ≤ 3} and B = {x ∈ R : 2 ≤ x < 4}. Then A ∩ B = {x ∈ R : 2 ≤ x ≤ 3} A ∪ B = {x ∈ R : 0 < x < 4} A \ B = {x ∈ R : 0 < x < 2} A = {x ∈ R : x ≤ 0 or x > 3 }.

SETS AND EQUIVALENCE RELATIONS

Proposition 0.1 Let A, B, and C be sets. Then 1. A ∪ A = A, A ∩ A = A, and A \ A = ∅; 2. A ∪ ∅ = A and A ∩ ∅ = ∅; 3. A ∪ (B ∪ C) = (A ∪ B) ∪ C and A ∩ (B ∩ C) = (A ∩ B) ∩ C; 4. A ∪ B = B ∪ A and A ∩ B = B ∩ A; 5. A ∪ (B ∩ C) = (A ∪ B) ∩ (A ∪ C); 6. A ∩ (B ∪ C) = (A ∩ B) ∪ (A ∩ C). Proof. We will prove (1) and (3) and leave the remaining results to be proven in the exercises. (1) Observe that A ∪ A = {x : x ∈ A or x ∈ A} = {x : x ∈ A} = A and A ∩ A = {x : x ∈ A and x ∈ A} = {x : x ∈ A} = A. Also, A \ A = A ∩ A = ∅. (3) For sets A, B, and C, A ∪ (B ∪ C) = A ∪ {x : x ∈ B or x ∈ C} = {x : x ∈ A or x ∈ B, or x ∈ C} = {x : x ∈ A or x ∈ B} ∪ C = (A ∪ B) ∪ C. A similar argument proves that A ∩ (B ∩ C) = (A ∩ B) ∩ C. Theorem 0.2 (De Morgan’s Laws) Let A and B be sets. Then 1. (A ∪ B) = A ∩ B ; 2. (A ∩ B) = A ∪ B .

8

CHAPTER 0

PRELIMINARIES

Proof. (1) We must show that (A ∪ B) ⊂ A ∩ B and (A ∪ B) ⊃ A ∩ B . Let x ∈ (A ∪ B) . Then x ∈ A ∪ B. So x is neither in A nor in B, by the / deﬁnition of the union of sets. By the deﬁnition of the complement, x ∈ A and x ∈ B . Therefore, x ∈ A ∩ B and we have (A ∪ B) ⊂ A ∩ B . To show the reverse inclusion, suppose that x ∈ A ∩ B . Then x ∈ A and x ∈ B , and so x ∈ A and x ∈ B. Thus x ∈ A ∪ B and so x ∈ (A ∪ B) . / / / Hence, (A ∪ B) ⊃ A ∩ B and so (A ∪ B) = A ∩ B . The proof of (2) is left as an exercise. Example 2. Other relations between sets often hold true. For example, (A \ B) ∩ (B \ A) = ∅. To see that this is true, observe that (A \ B) ∩ (B \ A) = (A ∩ B ) ∩ (B ∩ A ) = A∩A ∩B∩B = ∅.

Cartesian Products and Mappings
Given sets A and B, we can deﬁne a new set A × B, called the Cartesian product of A and B, as a set of ordered pairs. That is, A × B = {(a, b) : a ∈ A and b ∈ B}. Example 3. If A = {x, y}, B = {1, 2, 3}, and C = ∅, then A × B is the set {(x, 1), (x, 2), (x, 3), (y, 1), (y, 2), (y, 3)} and A × C = ∅.

We deﬁne the Cartesian product of n sets to be A1 × · · · × An = {(a1 , . . . , an ) : ai ∈ Ai for i = 1, . . . , n}. If A = A1 = A2 = · · · = An , we often write An for A × · · · × A (where A would be written n times). For example, the set R3 consists of all of 3-tuples of real numbers.

SETS AND EQUIVALENCE RELATIONS

Subsets of A × B are called relations. We will deﬁne a mapping or function f ⊂ A × B from a set A to a set B to be the special type of relation in which for each element a ∈ A there is a unique element b ∈ B such that (a, b) ∈ f ; another way of saying this is that for every element in A, f assigns a unique element in B. We usually write f : A → B or A → B. Instead of writing down ordered pairs (a, b) ∈ A × B, we write f (a) = b or f : a → b. The set A is called the domain of f and f (A) = {f (a) : a ∈ A} ⊂ B is called the range or image of f . We can think of the elements in the function’s domain as input values and the elements in the function’s range as output values.

Figure 1. Mappings Example 4. Suppose A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {a, b, c}. In Figure 1 we deﬁne relations f and g from A to B. The relation f is a mapping, but g is not because 1 ∈ A is not assigned to a unique element in B; that is, g(1) = a and g(1) = b. Given a function f : A → B, it is often possible to write a list describing what the function does to each speciﬁc element in the domain. However,

10

CHAPTER 0

PRELIMINARIES

not all functions can be described in this manner. For example, the function f : R → R that sends each real number to its cube is a mapping that must be described by writing f (x) = x3 or f : x → x3 . Consider the relation f : Q → Z given by f (p/q) = p. We know that 1/2 = 2/4, but is f (1/2) = 1 or 2? This relation cannot be a mapping because it is not well-deﬁned. A relation is well-deﬁned if each element in the domain is assigned to a unique element in the range. If f : A → B is a map and the image of f is B, i.e., f (A) = B, then f is said to be onto or surjective. A map is one-to-one or injective if a1 = a2 implies f (a1 ) = f (a2 ). Equivalently, a function is one-to-one if f (a1 ) = f (a2 ) implies a1 = a2 . A map that is both one-to-one and onto is called bijective. Example 5. Let f : Z → Q be deﬁned by f (n) = n/1. Then f is one-to-one but not onto. Deﬁne g : Q → Z by g(p/q) = p where p/q is a rational number expressed in its lowest terms with a positive denominator. The function g is onto but not one-to-one. Given two functions, we can construct a new function by using the range of the ﬁrst function as the domain of the second function. Let f : A → B and g : B → C be mappings. Deﬁne a new map, the composition of f and g from A to C, by (g ◦ f )(x) = g(f (x)).

Example 6. Consider the functions f : A → B and g : B → C that are deﬁned in Figure 0.2(a). The composition of these functions, g ◦ f : A → C, is deﬁned in Figure 0.2(b). Example 7. Let f (x) = x2 and g(x) = 2x + 5. Then (f ◦ g)(x) = f (g(x)) = (2x + 5)2 = 4x2 + 20x + 25 and (g ◦ f )(x) = g(f (x)) = 2x2 + 5. In general, order makes a diﬀerence; that is, in most cases f ◦ g = g ◦ f . Example 8. Sometimes it is the case that f ◦ g = g ◦ f . Let f (x) = x3 and √ g(x) = 3 x. Then √ √ (f ◦ g)(x) = f (g(x)) = f ( 3 x ) = ( 3 x )3 = x and (g ◦ f )(x) = g(f (x)) = g(x3 ) = √ 3 x3 = x.

Example 9. Given a 2 × 2 matrix A= a b , c d

we can deﬁne a map TA : R2 → R2 by TA (x, y) = (ax + by, cx + dy) for (x, y) in R2 . This is actually matrix multiplication; that is, a b c d x y = ax + by . cx + dy

Maps from Rn to Rm given by matrices are called linear maps or linear transformations. Example 10. Suppose that S = {1, 2, 3}. Deﬁne a map π : S → S by π(1) = 2 π(2) = 1 π(3) = 3.

This is a bijective map. An alternative way to write π is 1 2 3 π(1) π(2) π(3) = 1 2 3 . 2 1 3

For any set S, a one-to-one and onto mapping π : S → S is called a permutation of S. Theorem 0.3 Let f : A → B, g : B → C, and h : C → D. Then 1. The composition of mappings is associative; that is, (h ◦ g) ◦ f = h ◦ (g ◦ f ); 2. If f and g are both one-to-one, then the mapping g ◦ f is one-to-one; 3. If f and g are both onto, then the mapping g ◦ f is onto; 4. If f and g are bijective, then so is g ◦ f . Proof. We will prove (1) and (3). Part (2) is left as an exercise. Part (4) follows directly from (2) and (3). (1) We must show that h ◦ (g ◦ f ) = (h ◦ g) ◦ f. For a ∈ A we have (h ◦ (g ◦ f ))(a) = h((g ◦ f )(a)) = h(g(f (a))) = (h ◦ g)(f (a)) = ((h ◦ g) ◦ f )(a). (3) Assume that f and g are both onto functions. Given c ∈ C, we must show that there exists an a ∈ A such that (g ◦f )(a) = g(f (a)) = c. However, since g is onto, there is a b ∈ B such that g(b) = c. Similarly, there is an a ∈ A such that f (a) = b. Accordingly, (g ◦ f )(a) = g(f (a)) = g(b) = c.

If S is any set, we will use idS or id to denote the identity mapping from S to itself. Deﬁne this map by id(s) = s for all s ∈ S. A map g : B → A is an inverse mapping of f : A → B if g ◦f = idA and f ◦g = idB ; in other

words, the inverse function of a function simply “undoes” the function. A map is said to be invertible if it has an inverse. We usually write f −1 for the inverse of f . √ Example 11. The function f (x) = x3 has inverse f −1 (x) = 3 x by Example 8. Example 12. The natural logarithm and the exponential functions, f (x) = ln x and f −1 (x) = ex , are inverses of each other provided that we are careful about choosing domains. Observe that f (f −1 (x)) = f (ex ) = ln ex = x and f −1 (f (x)) = f −1 (ln x) = eln x = x whenever composition makes sense. Example 13. Suppose that A= 3 1 . 5 2

Then A deﬁnes a map from R2 to R2 by TA (x, y) = (3x + y, 5x + 2y). We can ﬁnd an inverse map of TA by simply inverting the matrix A; that is, −1 TA = TA−1 . In this example, A−1 = hence, the inverse map is given by
−1 TA (x, y) = (2x − y, −5x + 3y).

It is easy to check that
−1 −1 TA ◦ TA (x, y) = TA ◦ TA (x, y) = (x, y).

Not every map has an inverse. If we consider the map TB (x, y) = (3x, 0)

then an inverse map would have to be of the form
−1 TB (x, y) = (ax + by, cx + dy)

and
−1 (x, y) = T ◦ TB (x, y) = (3ax + 3by, 0)

for all x and y. Clearly this is impossible because y might not be 0. Example 14. Given the permutation π= 1 2 3 2 3 1

on S = {1, 2, 3}, it is easy to see that the permutation deﬁned by π −1 = 1 2 3 3 1 2

is the inverse of π. In fact, any bijective mapping possesses an inverse, as we will see in the next theorem. Theorem 0.4 A mapping is invertible if and only if it is both one-to-one and onto. Proof. Suppose ﬁrst that f : A → B is invertible with inverse g : B → A. Then g ◦ f = idA is the identity map; that is, g(f (a)) = a. If a1 , a2 ∈ A with f (a1 ) = f (a2 ), then a1 = g(f (a1 )) = g(f (a2 )) = a2 . Consequently, f is one-to-one. Now suppose that b ∈ B. To show that f is onto, it is necessary to ﬁnd an a ∈ A such that f (a) = b, but f (g(b)) = b with g(b) ∈ A. Let a = g(b). Now assume the converse; that is, let f be bijective. Let b ∈ B. Since f is onto, there exists an a ∈ A such that f (a) = b. Because f is one-to-one, a must be unique. Deﬁne g by letting g(b) = a. We have now constructed the inverse of f .

SETS AND EQUIVALENCE RELATIONS

Equivalence Relations and Partitions
A fundamental notion in mathematics is that of equality. We can generalize equality with the introduction of equivalence relations and equivalence classes. An equivalence relation on a set X is a relation R ⊂ X × X such that • (x, x) ∈ R for all x ∈ X (reﬂexive property); • (x, y) ∈ R implies (y, x) ∈ R (symmetric property); • (x, y) and (y, z) ∈ R imply (x, z) ∈ R (transitive property). Given an equivalence relation R on a set X, we usually write x ∼ y instead of (x, y) ∈ R. If the equivalence relation already has an associated notation such as =, ≡, or ∼ we will use that notation. =, Example 15. Let p, q, r, and s be integers, where q and s are nonzero. Deﬁne p/q ∼ r/s if ps = qr. Clearly ∼ is reﬂexive and symmetric. To show that it is also transitive, suppose that p/q ∼ r/s and r/s ∼ t/u, with q, s, and u all nonzero. Then ps = qr and ru = st. Therefore, psu = qru = qst. Since s = 0, pu = qt. Consequently, p/q ∼ t/u. Example 16. Suppose that f and g are diﬀerentiable functions on R. We can deﬁne an equivalence relation on such functions by letting f (x) ∼ g(x) if f (x) = g (x). It is clear that ∼ is both reﬂexive and symmetric. To demonstrate transitivity, suppose that f (x) ∼ g(x) and g(x) ∼ h(x). From calculus we know that f (x) − g(x) = c1 and g(x) − h(x) = c2 , where c1 and c2 are both constants. Hence, f (x) − h(x) = (f (x) − g(x)) + (g(x) − h(x)) = c1 − c2 and f (x) − h (x) = 0. Therefore, f (x) ∼ h(x). Example 17. For (x1 , y1 ) and (x2 , y2 ) in R2 , deﬁne (x1 , y1 ) ∼ (x2 , y2 ) if 2 2 x2 + y1 = x2 + y2 . Then ∼ is an equivalence relation on R2 . 1 2 Example 18. Let A and B be 2 × 2 matrices with entries in the real numbers. We can deﬁne an equivalence relation on the set of 2 × 2 matrices, by saying A ∼ B if there exists an invertible matrix P such that P AP −1 = B. For example, if 1 2 A= −1 1

16 and B= then A ∼ B since P AP −1 = B for P =

Let I be the 2 × 2 identity matrix; that is, I= 1 0 . 0 1

Then IAI −1 = IAI = A; therefore, the relation is reﬂexive. To show symmetry, suppose that A ∼ B. Then there exists an invertible matrix P such that P AP −1 = B. So A = P −1 BP = P −1 B(P −1 )−1 . Finally, suppose that A ∼ B and B ∼ C. Then there exist invertible matrices P and Q such that P AP −1 = B and QBQ−1 = C. Since C = QBQ−1 = QP AP −1 Q−1 = (QP )A(QP )−1 , the relation is transitive. Two matrices that are equivalent in this manner are said to be similar. A partition P of a set X is a collection of nonempty sets X1 , X2 , . . . such that Xi ∩ Xj = ∅ for i = j and k Xk = X. Let ∼ be an equivalence relation on a set X and let x ∈ X. Then [x] = {y ∈ X : y ∼ x} is called the equivalence class of x. We will see that an equivalence relation gives rise to a partition via equivalence classes. Also, whenever a partition of a set exists, there is some natural underlying equivalence relation, as the following theorem demonstrates. Theorem 0.5 Given an equivalence relation ∼ on a set X, the equivalence classes of X form a partition of X. Conversely, if P = {Xi } is a partition of a set X, then there is an equivalence relation on X with equivalence classes Xi . Proof. Suppose there exists an equivalence relation ∼ on the set X. For any x ∈ X, the reﬂexive property shows that x ∈ [x] and so [x] is nonempty. Clearly X = x∈X [x]. Now let x, y ∈ X. We need to show that either

0.2

SETS AND EQUIVALENCE RELATIONS

[x] = [y] or [x] ∩ [y] = ∅. Suppose that the intersection of [x] and [y] is not empty and that z ∈ [x] ∩ [y]. Then z ∼ x and z ∼ y. By symmetry and transitivity x ∼ y; hence, [x] ⊂ [y]. Similarly, [y] ⊂ [x] and so [x] = [y]. Therefore, any two equivalence classes are either disjoint or exactly the same. Conversely, suppose that P = {Xi } is a partition of a set X. Let two elements be equivalent if they are in the same partition. Clearly, the relation is reﬂexive. If x is in the same partition as y, then y is in the same partition as x, so x ∼ y implies y ∼ x. Finally, if x is in the same partition as y and y is in the same partition as z, then x must be in the same partition as z, and transitivity holds. Corollary 0.6 Two equivalence classes of an equivalence relation are either disjoint or equal. Let us examine some of the partitions given by the equivalence classes in the last set of examples. Example 19. In the equivalence relation in Example 15, two pairs of integers, (p, q) and (r, s), are in the same equivalence class when they reduce to the same fraction in its lowest terms. Example 20. In the equivalence relation in Example 16, two functions f (x) and g(x) are in the same partition when they diﬀer by a constant. Example 21. We deﬁned an equivalence class on R2 by (x1 , y1 ) ∼ (x2 , y2 ) 2 2 if x2 + y1 = x2 + y2 . Two pairs of real numbers are in the same partition 1 2 when they lie on the same circle about the origin. Example 22. Let r and s be two integers and suppose that n ∈ N. We say that r is congruent to s modulo n, or r is congruent to s mod n, if r − s is evenly divisible by n; that is, r − s = nk for some k ∈ Z. In this case we write r ≡ s (mod n). For example, 41 ≡ 17 (mod 8) since 41 − 17 = 24 is divisible by 8. We claim that congruence modulo n forms an equivalence relation of Z. Certainly any integer r is equivalent to itself since r − r = 0 is divisible by n. We will now show that the relation is symmetric. If r ≡ s (mod n), then r −s = −(s−r) is divisible by n. So s−r is divisible by n and s ≡ r (mod n). Now suppose that r ≡ s (mod n) and s ≡ t (mod n). Then there exist integers k and l such that r − s = kn and s − t = ln. To show transitivity, it is necessary to prove that r − t is divisible by n. However, r − t = r − s + s − t = kn + ln = (k + l)n, and so r − t is divisible by n.

If we consider the equivalence relation established by the integers modulo 3, then [0] = {. . . , −3, 0, 3, 6, . . .}, [1] = {. . . , −2, 1, 4, 7, . . .}, [2] = {. . . , −1, 2, 5, 8, . . .}. Notice that [0] ∪ [1] ∪ [2] = Z and also that the sets are disjoint. The sets [0], [1], and [2] form a partition of the integers. The integers modulo n are a very important example in the study of abstract algebra and will become quite useful in our investigation of various algebraic structures such as groups and rings. In our discussion of the integers modulo n we have actually assumed a result known as the division algorithm, which will be stated and proved in Chapter 1.

The Integers

The integers are the building blocks of mathematics. In this chapter we will investigate the fundamental properties of the integers, including mathematical induction, the division algorithm, and the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic.

Mathematical Induction
n(n + 1) 2

Suppose we wish to show that 1 + 2 + ··· + n =

for any natural number n. This formula is easily veriﬁed for small numbers such as n = 1, 2, 3, or 4, but it is impossible to verify for all natural numbers on a case-by-case basis. To prove the formula true in general, a more generic method is required. Suppose we have veriﬁed the equation for the ﬁrst n cases. We will attempt to show that we can generate the formula for the (n + 1)th case from this knowledge. The formula is true for n = 1 since 1= 1(1 + 1) . 2

If we have veriﬁed the ﬁrst n cases, then 1 + 2 + · · · + n + (n + 1) = = = 22 n(n + 1) +n+1 2 n2 + 3n + 2 2 (n + 1)[(n + 1) + 1] . 2

1.1

MATHEMATICAL INDUCTION

23

This is exactly the formula for the (n + 1)th case. This method of proof is known as mathematical induction. Instead of attempting to verify a statement about some subset S of the positive integers N on a case-by-case basis, an impossible task if S is an inﬁnite set, we give a speciﬁc proof for the smallest integer being considered, followed by a generic argument showing that if the statement holds for a given case, then it must also hold for the next case in the sequence. We summarize mathematical induction in the following axiom. First Principle of Mathematical Induction. Let S(n) be a statement about integers for n ∈ N and suppose S(n0 ) is true for some integer n0 . If for all integers k with k ≥ n0 S(k) implies that S(k + 1) is true, then S(n) is true for all integers n greater than n0 . Example 1. For all integers n ≥ 3, 2n > n + 4. Since 8 = 23 > 3 + 4 = 7, the statement is true for n0 = 3. Assume that 2k > k + 4 for k ≥ 3. Then 2k+1 = 2 · 2k > 2(k + 4). But 2(k + 4) = 2k + 8 > k + 5 = (k + 1) + 4 since k is positive. Hence, by induction, the statement holds for all integers n ≥ 3. Example 2. Every integer 10n+1 + 3 · 10n + 5 is divisible by 9 for n ∈ N. For n = 1, 101+1 + 3 · 10 + 5 = 135 = 9 · 15 is divisible by 9. Suppose that 10k+1 + 3 · 10k + 5 is divisible by 9 for k ≥ 1. Then 10(k+1)+1 + 3 · 10k+1 + 5 = 10k+2 + 3 · 10k+1 + 50 − 45 = 10(10k+1 + 3 · 10k + 5) − 45 is divisible by 9. Example 3. We will prove the binomial theorem using mathematical induction; that is, n n (a + b)n = ak bn−k , k

If n = 1, the binomial theorem is easy to verify. Now assume that the result is true for n greater than or equal to 1. Then (a + b)n+1 = (a + b)(a + b)n

MATHEMATICAL INDUCTION

We have an equivalent statement of the Principle of Mathematical Induction that is often very useful: Second Principle of Mathematical Induction. Let S(n) be a statement about integers for n ∈ N and suppose S(n0 ) is true for some integer n0 . If S(n0 ), S(n0 +1), . . . , S(k) imply that S(k +1) for k ≥ n0 , then the statement S(n) is true for all integers n greater than n0 . A nonempty subset S of Z is well-ordered if S contains a least element. Notice that the set Z is not well-ordered since it does not contain a smallest element. However, the natural numbers are well-ordered. Principle of Well-Ordering. Every nonempty subset of the natural numbers is well-ordered. The Principle of Well-Ordering is equivalent to the Principle of Mathematical Induction. Lemma 1.1 The Principle of Mathematical Induction implies that 1 is the least positive natural number. Proof. Let S = {n ∈ N : n ≥ 1}. Then 1 ∈ S. Now assume that n ∈ S; that is, n ≥ 1. Since n + 1 ≥ 1, n + 1 ∈ S; hence, by induction, every natural number is greater than or equal to 1. Theorem 1.2 The Principle of Mathematical Induction implies that the natural numbers are well-ordered. Proof. We must show that if S is a nonempty subset of the natural numbers, then S contains a smallest element. If S contains 1, then the theorem is true by Lemma 1.1. Assume that if S contains an integer k such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, then S contains a smallest element. We will show that if a set S contains an integer less than or equal to n+1, then S has a smallest element. If S does not contain an integer less than n + 1, then n + 1 is the smallest integer in S. Otherwise, since S is nonempty, S must contain an integer less than or equal to n. In this case, by induction, S contains a smallest integer. Induction can also be very useful in formulating deﬁnitions. For instance, there are two ways to deﬁne n!, the factorial of a positive integer n. • The explicit deﬁnition: n! = 1 · 2 · 3 · · · (n − 1) · n. • The inductive or recursive deﬁnition: 1! = 1 and n! = n(n − 1)! for n > 1.

CHAPTER 1

THE INTEGERS

Every good mathematician or computer scientist knows that looking at problems recursively, as opposed to explicitly, often results in better understanding of complex issues.

1.2

The Division Algorithm

An application of the Principle of Well-Ordering that we will use often is the division algorithm. Theorem 1.3 (Division Algorithm) Let a and b be integers, with b > 0. Then there exist unique integers q and r such that a = bq + r where 0 ≤ r < b. Proof. This is a perfect example of the existence-and-uniqueness type of proof. We must ﬁrst prove that the numbers q and r actually exist. Then we must show that if q and r are two other such numbers, then q = q and r=r. Existence of q and r. Let S = {a − bk : k ∈ Z and a − bk ≥ 0}. If 0 ∈ S, then b divides a, and we can let q = a/b and r = 0. If 0 ∈ S, we can / use the Well-Ordering Principle. We must ﬁrst show that S is nonempty. If a > 0, then a − b · 0 ∈ S. If a < 0, then a − b(2a) = a(1 − 2b) ∈ S. In either case S = ∅. By the Well-Ordering Principle, S must have a smallest member, say r = a − bq. Therefore, a = bq + r, r ≥ 0. We now show that r < b. Suppose that r > b. Then a − b(q + 1) = a − bq − b = r − b > 0. In this case we would have a − b(q + 1) in the set S. But then a − b(q + 1) < a−bq, which would contradict the fact that r = a−bq is the smallest member of S. So r ≤ b. Since 0 ∈ S, r = b and so r < b. / Uniqueness of q and r. Suppose there exist integers r, r , q, and q such that a = bq + r, 0 ≤ r < b and a = bq + r , 0 ≤ r < b.

1.2

THE DIVISION ALGORITHM

27

Then bq + r = bq + r . Assume that r ≥ r. From the last equation we have b(q − q ) = r − r; therefore, b must divide r − r and 0 ≤ r − r ≤ r < b. This is possible only if r − r = 0. Hence, r = r and q = q . Let a and b be integers. If b = ak for some integer k, we write a | b. An integer d is called a common divisor of a and b if d | a and d | b. The greatest common divisor of integers a and b is a positive integer d such that d is a common divisor of a and b and if d is any other common divisor of a and b, then d | d. We write d = gcd(a, b); for example, gcd(24, 36) = 12 and gcd(120, 102) = 6. We say that two integers a and b are relatively prime if gcd(a, b) = 1. Theorem 1.4 Let a and b be nonzero integers. Then there exist integers r and s such that gcd(a, b) = ar + bs. Furthermore, the greatest common divisor of a and b is unique. Proof. Let S = {am + bn : m, n ∈ Z and am + bn > 0}. Clearly, the set S is nonempty; hence, by the Well-Ordering Principle S must have a smallest member, say d = ar + bs. We claim that d = gcd(a, b). Write a = dq + r where 0 ≤ r < d . If r > 0, then r = a − dq = a − (ar + bs)q = a − arq − bsq = a(1 − rq) + b(−sq), which is in S. But this would contradict the fact that d is the smallest member of S. Hence, r = 0 and d divides a. A similar argument shows that d divides b. Therefore, d is a common divisor of a and b. Suppose that d is another common divisor of a and b, and we want to show that d | d. If we let a = d h and b = d k, then d = ar + bs = d hr + d ks = d (hr + ks). So d must divide d. Hence, d must be the unique greatest common divisor of a and b. Corollary 1.5 Let a and b be two integers that are relatively prime. Then there exist integers r and s such that ar + bs = 1.

28

CHAPTER 1

THE INTEGERS

The Euclidean Algorithm
Among other things, Theorem 1.4 allows us to compute the greatest common divisor of two integers. Example 4. Let us compute the greatest common divisor of 945 and 2415. First observe that 2415 = 945 · 2 + 525 945 = 525 · 1 + 420 525 = 420 · 1 + 105 420 = 105 · 4 + 0. Reversing our steps, 105 divides 420, 105 divides 525, 105 divides 945, and 105 divides 2415. Hence, 105 divides both 945 and 2415. If d were another common divisor of 945 and 2415, then d would also have to divide 105. Therefore, gcd(945, 2415) = 105. If we work backward through the above sequence of equations, we can also obtain numbers r and s such that 945r + 2415s = 105. Observe that 105 = 525 + (−1) · 420 = 525 + (−1) · [945 + (−1) · 525] = 2 · 525 + (−1) · 945 = 2 · [2415 + (−2) · 945] + (−1) · 945 = 2 · 2415 + (−5) · 945. So r = −5 and s = 2. Notice that r and s are not unique, since r = 41 and s = −16 would also work. To compute gcd(a, b) = d, we are using repeated divisions to obtain a decreasing sequence of positive integers r1 > r2 > · · · > rn = d; that is, b = aq1 + r1 a = r1 q2 + r2 r1 = r2 q3 + r3 . . . rn−2 = rn−1 qn + rn rn−1 = rn qn+1 .

1.2

THE DIVISION ALGORITHM

29

To ﬁnd r and s such that ar + bs = d, we begin with this last equation and substitute results obtained from the previous equations: d = rn = rn−2 − rn−1 qn = rn−2 − qn (rn−3 − qn−1 rn−2 ) = −qn rn−3 + (1 + qn qn−1 )rn−2 . . . = ra + sb. The algorithm that we have just used to ﬁnd the greatest common divisor d of two integers a and b and to write d as the linear combination of a and b is known as the Euclidean algorithm.

Prime Numbers
Let p be an integer such that p > 1. We say that p is a prime number, or simply p is prime, if the only positive numbers that divide p are 1 and p itself. An integer n > 1 that is not prime is said to be composite. Lemma 1.6 (Euclid) Let a and b be integers and p be a prime number. If p | ab, then either p | a or p | b. Proof. Suppose that p does not divide a. We must show that p | b. Since gcd(a, p) = 1, there exist integers r and s such that ar + ps = 1. So b = b(ar + ps) = (ab)r + p(bs). Since p divides both ab and itself, p must divide b = (ab)r + p(bs). Theorem 1.7 (Euclid) There exist an inﬁnite number of primes. Proof. We will prove this theorem by contradiction. Suppose that there are only a ﬁnite number of primes, say p1 , p2 , . . . , pn . Let p = p1 p2 · · · pn + 1. We will show that p must be a diﬀerent prime number, which contradicts the assumption that we have only n primes. If p is not prime, then it must be divisible by some pi for 1 ≤ i ≤ n. In this case pi must divide p1 p2 · · · pn and also divide 1. This is a contradiction, since p > 1.

CHAPTER 1

THE INTEGERS

Theorem 1.8 (Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic) Let n be an integer such that n > 1. Then n = p1 p2 · · · pk , where p1 , . . . , pk are primes (not necessarily distinct). Furthermore, this factorization is unique; that is, if n = q1 q2 · · · ql , then k = l and the qi ’s are just the pi ’s rearranged. Proof. Uniqueness. To show uniqueness we will use induction on n. The theorem is certainly true for n = 2 since in this case n is prime. Now assume that the result holds for all integers m such that 1 ≤ m < n, and n = p1 p2 · · · pk = q1 q2 · · · ql , where p1 ≤ p2 ≤ · · · ≤ pk and q1 ≤ q2 ≤ · · · ≤ ql . By Lemma 1.6, p1 | qi for some i = 1, . . . , l and q1 | pj for some j = 1, . . . , k. Since all of the pi ’s and qi ’s are prime, p1 = qi and q1 = pj . Hence, p1 = q1 since p1 ≤ pj = q1 ≤ qi = p1 . By the induction hypothesis, n = p2 · · · pk = q2 · · · ql has a unique factorization. Hence, k = l and qi = pi for i = 1, . . . , k. Existence. To show existence, suppose that there is some integer that cannot be written as the product of primes. Let S be the set of all such numbers. By the Principle of Well-Ordering, S has a smallest number, say a. If the only positive factors of a are a and 1, then a is prime, which is a contradiction. Hence, a = a1 a2 where 1 < a1 < a and 1 < a2 < a. Neither a1 ∈ S nor a2 ∈ S, since a is the smallest element in S. So a1 = p 1 · · · p r a2 = q1 · · · qs . Therefore, a = a1 a2 = p1 · · · pr q1 · · · qs . So a ∈ S, which is a contradiction. / Historical Note

EXERCISES

31

Prime numbers were ﬁrst studied by the ancient Greeks. Two important results from antiquity are Euclid’s proof that an inﬁnite number of primes exist and the Sieve of Eratosthenes, a method of computing all of the prime numbers less than a ﬁxed positive integer n. One problem in number theory is to ﬁnd a function f such that f (n) is prime for each integer n. Pierre Fermat (1601?–1665) conjectured that n 22 + 1 was prime for all n, but later it was shown by Leonhard Euler (1707–1783) that 5 22 + 1 = 4,294,967,297 is a composite number. One of the many unproven conjectures about prime numbers is Goldbach’s Conjecture. In a letter to Euler in 1742, Christian Goldbach stated the conjecture that every even integer with the exception of 2 seemed to be the sum of two primes: 4 = 2 + 2, 6 = 3 + 3, 8 = 3 + 5, . . .. Although the conjecture has been veriﬁed for the numbers up through 100 million, it has yet to be proven in general. Since prime numbers play an important role in public key cryptography, there is currently a great deal of interest in determining whether or not a large number is prime.

1. The Sieve of Eratosthenes. One method of computing all of the prime numbers less than a certain ﬁxed positive integer N is to list all of the numbers n such that 1 < n < N . Begin by eliminating all of the multiples of 2. Next eliminate all of the multiples of 3. Now eliminate all of the multiples of 5. Notice that 4 has already been crossed out. Continue in this manner, noticing √ that we do not have to go all the way to N ; it suﬃces to stop at N . Using this method, compute all of the prime numbers less than N = 250. We can also use this method to ﬁnd all of the integers that are relatively prime to an integer N . Simply eliminate the prime factors of N and all of their multiples. Using this method, ﬁnd all of the numbers that are relatively prime to N = 120. Using the Sieve of Eratosthenes, write a program that will compute all of the primes less than an integer N . 2. Let N0 = N ∪ {0}. Ackermann’s function is the function A : N0 × N0 → N0 deﬁned by the equations A(0, y) A(x + 1, 0) A(x + 1, y + 1) = y + 1, = = A(x, 1), A(x, A(x + 1, y)).

Use this deﬁnition to compute A(3, 1). Write a program to evaluate Ackermann’s function. Modify the program to count the number of statements executed in the program when Ackermann’s function is evaluated. How many statements are executed in the evaluation of A(4, 1)? What about A(5, 1)? 3. Write a computer program that will implement the Euclidean algorithm. The program should accept two positive integers a and b as input and should output gcd(a, b) as well as integers r and s such that gcd(a, b) = ra + sb.

Groups

We begin our study of algebraic structures by investigating sets associated with single operations that satisfy certain reasonable axioms; that is, we want to deﬁne an operation on a set in a way that will generalize such familiar structures as the integers Z together with the single operation of addition, or invertible 2 × 2 matrices together with the single operation of matrix multiplication. The integers and the 2 × 2 matrices, together with their respective single operations, are examples of algebraic structures known as groups. The theory of groups occupies a central position in mathematics. Modern group theory arose from an attempt to ﬁnd the roots of a polynomial in terms of its coeﬃcients. Groups now play a central role in such areas as coding theory, counting, and the study of symmetries; many areas of biology, chemistry, and physics have beneﬁted from group theory.

2.1

The Integers mod n and Symmetries

Let us now investigate some mathematical structures that can be viewed as sets with single operations.

The Integers mod n
The integers mod n have become indispensable in the theory and applications of algebra. In mathematics they are used in cryptography, coding theory, and the detection of errors in identiﬁcation codes. We have already seen that two integers a and b are equivalent mod n if n divides a − b. The integers mod n also partition Z into n diﬀerent equivalence classes; we will denote the set of these equivalence classes by 35

Zn . Consider the integers modulo 12 and the corresponding partition of the integers: [0] = {. . . , −12, 0, 12, 24, . . .}, [1] = {. . . , −11, 1, 13, 25, . . .}, . . . [11] = {. . . , −1, 11, 23, 35, . . .}. When no confusion can arise, we will use 0, 1, . . . , 11 to indicate the equivalence classes [0], [1], . . . , [11] respectively. We can do arithmetic on Zn . For two integers a and b, deﬁne addition modulo n to be (a+b) (mod n); that is, the remainder when a + b is divided by n. Similarly, multiplication modulo n is deﬁned as (ab) (mod n), the remainder when ab is divided by n. Example 1. The following examples illustrate integer arithmetic modulo n: 7 + 4 ≡ 1 (mod 5) 3 + 5 ≡ 0 (mod 8) 3 + 4 ≡ 7 (mod 12) 7 · 3 ≡ 1 (mod 5) 3 · 5 ≡ 7 (mod 8) 3 · 4 ≡ 0 (mod 12).

In particular, notice that it is possible that the product of two nonzero numbers modulo n can be equivalent to 0 modulo n. Table 2.1. Multiplication table for Z8

Example 2. Most, but not all, of the usual laws of arithmetic hold for addition and multiplication in Zn . For instance, it is not necessarily true that there is a multiplicative inverse. Consider the multiplication table for Z8 in Table 2.1. Notice that 2, 4, and 6 do not have multiplicative inverses; that is, for n = 2, 4, or 6, there is no integer k such that kn ≡ 1 (mod 8).

Proposition 2.1 Let Zn be the set of equivalence classes of the integers mod n and a, b, c ∈ Zn . 1. Addition and multiplication are commutative: a + b ≡ b + a (mod n) ab ≡ ba (mod n). 2. Addition and multiplication are associative: (a + b) + c ≡ a + (b + c) (ab)c ≡ a(bc) (mod n)

(mod n).

3. There are both an additive and a multiplicative identity: a + 0 ≡ a (mod n) a · 1 ≡ a (mod n). 4. Multiplication distributes over addition: a(b + c) ≡ ab + ac (mod n). 5. For every integer a there is an additive inverse −a: a + (−a) ≡ 0 (mod n).

6. Let a be a nonzero integer. Then gcd(a, n) = 1 if and only if there exists a multiplicative inverse b for a (mod n); that is, a nonzero integer b such that ab ≡ 1 (mod n). Proof. We will prove (1) and (6) and leave the remaining properties to be proven in the exercises. (1) Addition and multiplication are commutative modulo n since the remainder of a + b divided by n is the same as the remainder of b + a divided by n. (6) Suppose that gcd(a, n) = 1. Then there exist integers r and s such that ar + ns = 1. Since ns = 1 − ar, ra ≡ 1 (mod n). Letting b be the equivalence class of r, ab ≡ 1 (mod n). Conversely, suppose that there exists a b such that ab ≡ 1 (mod n). Then n divides ab − 1, so there is an integer k such that ab − nk = 1. Let d = gcd(a, n). Since d divides ab − nk, d must also divide 1; hence, d = 1.

GROUPS

Symmetries
A symmetry of a geometric ﬁgure is a rearrangement of the ﬁgure preserving the arrangement of its sides and vertices as well as its distances and angles. A map from the plane to itself preserving the symmetry of an object is called a rigid motion. For example, if we look at the rectangle in Figure 2.1, it is easy to see that a rotation of 180◦ or 360◦ returns a rectangle in the plane with the same orientation as the original rectangle and the same relationship among the vertices. A reﬂection of the rectangle across either the vertical axis or the horizontal axis can also be seen to be a symmetry. However, a 90◦ rotation in either direction cannot be a symmetry unless the rectangle is a square.

Figure 2.1. Rigid motions of a rectangle Let us ﬁnd the symmetries of the equilateral triangle ABC. To ﬁnd a symmetry of ABC, we must ﬁrst examine the permutations of the vertices A, B, and C and then ask if a permutation extends to a symmetry of the triangle. Recall that a permutation of a set S is a one-to-one and onto map π : S → S. The three vertices have 3! = 6 permutations, so the triangle has at most six symmetries. To see that there are six permutations, observe there are three diﬀerent possibilities for the ﬁrst vertex, and two for the second, and the remaining vertex is determined by the placement of the

B C A Notice that this particular permutation corresponds to the rigid motion of rotating the triangle by 120◦ in a clockwise direction. In fact, every permutation gives rise to a symmetry of the triangle. All of these symmetries are shown in Figure 2.2.

Notice that in the multiplication table for the symmetries of an equilateral triangle, for every motion of the triangle α there is another motion α such that αα = id; that is, for every motion there is another motion that takes the triangle back to its original orientation.

Deﬁnitions and Examples

The integers mod n and the symmetries of a triangle or a rectangle are both examples of groups. A binary operation or law of composition on a set G is a function G × G → G that assigns to each pair (a, b) ∈ G a unique element a ◦ b, or ab in G, called the composition of a and b. A group (G, ◦) is a set G together with a law of composition (a, b) → a ◦ b that satisﬁes the following axioms. • The law of composition is associative. That is, (a ◦ b) ◦ c = a ◦ (b ◦ c) for a, b, c ∈ G.

• There exists an element e ∈ G, called the identity element, such that for any element a ∈ G e ◦ a = a ◦ e = a. • For each element a ∈ G, there exists an inverse element in G, denoted by a−1 , such that a ◦ a−1 = a−1 ◦ a = e. A group G with the property that a ◦ b = b ◦ a for all a, b ∈ G is called abelian or commutative. Groups not satisfying this property are said to be nonabelian or noncommutative. Example 3. The integers Z = {. . . , −1, 0, 1, 2, . . .} form a group under the operation of addition. The binary operation on two integers m, n ∈ Z is just their sum. Since the integers under addition already have a well-established notation, we will use the operator + instead of ◦; that is, we shall write m+n instead of m ◦ n. The identity is 0, and the inverse of n ∈ Z is written as −n instead of n−1 . Notice that the integers under addition have the additional property that m + n = n + m and are therefore an abelian group. Most of the time we will write ab instead of a ◦ b; however, if the group already has a natural operation such as addition in the integers, we will use that operation. That is, if we are adding two integers, we still write m + n, −n for the inverse, and 0 for the identity as usual. We also write m − n instead of m + (−n). Table 2.3. Cayley table for (Z5 , +)

It is often convenient to describe a group in terms of an addition or multiplication table. Such a table is called a Cayley table. Example 4. The integers mod n form a group under addition modulo n. Consider Z5 , consisting of the equivalence classes of the integers 0, 1, 2, 3,

GROUPS

and 4. We deﬁne the group operation on Z5 by modular addition. We write the binary operation on the group additively; that is, we write m + n. The element 0 is the identity of the group and each element in Z5 has an inverse. For instance, 2 + 3 = 3 + 2 = 0. Table 2.2 is a Cayley table for Z5 . By Proposition 2.1, Zn = {0, 1, . . . , n − 1} is a group under the binary operation of addition mod n. Example 5. Not every set with a binary operation is a group. For example, if we let modular multiplication be the binary operation on Zn , then Zn fails to be a group. The element 1 acts as a group identity since 1 · k = k · 1 = k for any k ∈ Zn ; however, a multiplicative inverse for 0 does not exist since 0 · k = k · 0 = 0 for every k in Zn . Even if we consider the set Zn \ {0}, we still may not have a group. For instance, let 2 ∈ Z6 . Then 2 has no multiplicative inverse since 0·2 = 0 2·2 = 4 4·2 = 2 1·2 = 2 3·2 = 0 5 · 2 = 4.

By Proposition 2.1, every nonzero k does have an inverse in Zn if k is relatively prime to n. Denote the set of all such nonzero elements in Zn by U (n). Then U (n) is a group called the group of units of Zn . Table 2.42.2 is a Cayley table for the group U (8). Table 2.4. Multiplication table for U (8)

Example 6. The symmetries of an equilateral triangle described in Section 2.1 form a nonabelian group. As we observed, it is not necessarily true that αβ = βα for two symmetries α and β. Using Table 2.22.1, which is a Cayley table for this group, we can easily check that the symmetries of an equilateral triangle are indeed a group. We will denote this group by either S3 or D3 , for reasons that will be explained later. Example 7. We use M2 (R) to denote the set of all 2 × 2 matrices. Let GL2 (R) be the subset of M2 (R) consisting of invertible matrices; that is, a

2.2

matrix A= a b c d

is in GL2 (R) if there exists a matrix A−1 such that AA−1 = A−1 A = I, where I is the 2 × 2 identity matrix. For A to have an inverse is equivalent to requiring that the determinant of A be nonzero; that is, det A = ad−bc = 0. The set of invertible matrices forms a group called the general linear group. The identity of the group is the identity matrix I= The inverse of A ∈ GL2 (R) is A−1 = 1 ad − bc d −b −c a . 1 0 0 1 .

The product of two invertible matrices is again invertible. Matrix multiplication is associative, satisfying the other group axiom. For matrices it is not true in general that AB = BA; hence, GL2 (R) is another example of a nonabelian group. Example 8. Let 1 = I = J = 1 0 0 1 0 1 −1 0 0 i i 0 i 0 0 −i ,

K =

where i2 = −1. Then the relations I 2 = J 2 = K 2 = −1, IJ = K, JK = I, KI = J, JI = −K, KJ = −I, and IK = −J hold. The set Q8 = {±1, ±I, ±J, ±K} is a group called the quaternion group. Notice that Q8 is noncommutative. Example 9. Let C∗ be the set of nonzero complex numbers. Under the operation of multiplication C∗ forms a group. The identity is 1. If z = a + bi is a nonzero complex number, then z −1 = a − bi a2 + b2

is the inverse of z. It is easy to see that the remaining group axioms hold. A group is ﬁnite, or has ﬁnite order, if it contains a ﬁnite number of elements; otherwise, the group is said to be inﬁnite or to have inﬁnite order. The order of a ﬁnite group is the number of elements that it contains. If G is a group containing n elements, we write |G| = n. The group Z5 is a ﬁnite group of order 5; the integers Z form an inﬁnite group under addition, and we sometimes write |Z| = ∞.

Basic Properties of Groups
Proposition 2.2 The identity element in a group G is unique; that is, there exists only one element e ∈ G such that eg = ge = g for all g ∈ G. Proof. Suppose that e and e are both identities in G. Then eg = ge = g and e g = ge = g for all g ∈ G. We need to show that e = e . If we think of e as the identity, then ee = e ; but if e is the identity, then ee = e. Combining these two equations, we have e = ee = e . Inverses in a group are also unique. If g and g are both inverses of an element g in a group G, then gg = g g = e and gg = g g = e. We want to show that g = g , but g = g e = g (gg ) = (g g)g = eg = g . We summarize this fact in the following proposition. Proposition 2.3 If g is any element in a group G, then the inverse of g, g −1 , is unique. Proposition 2.4 Let G be a group. If a, b ∈ G, then (ab)−1 = b−1 a−1 . Proof. Let a, b ∈ G. Then abb−1 a−1 = aea−1 = aa−1 = e. Similarly, b−1 a−1 ab = e. But by the previous proposition, inverses are unique; hence, (ab)−1 = b−1 a−1 . Proposition 2.5 Let G be a group. For any a ∈ G, (a−1 )−1 = a. Proof. Observe that a−1 (a−1 )−1 = e. Consequently, multiplying both sides of this equation by a, we have (a−1 )−1 = e(a−1 )−1 = aa−1 (a−1 )−1 = ae = a.

It makes sense to write equations with group elements and group operations. If a and b are two elements in a group G, does there exist an element x ∈ G such that ax = b? If such an x does exist, is it unique? The following proposition answers both of these questions positively. Proposition 2.6 Let G be a group and a and b be any two elements in G. Then the equations ax = b and xa = b have unique solutions in G. Proof. Suppose that ax = b. We must show that such an x exists. Multiplying both sides of ax = b by a−1 , we have x = ex = a−1 ax = a−1 b. To show uniqueness, suppose that x1 and x2 are both solutions of ax = b; then ax1 = b = ax2 . So x1 = a−1 ax1 = a−1 ax2 = x2 . The proof for the existence and uniqueness of the solution of xa = b is similar. Proposition 2.7 If G is a group and a, b, c ∈ G, then ba = ca implies b = c and ab = ac implies b = c. This proposition tells us that the right and left cancellation laws are true in groups. We leave the proof as an exercise. We can use exponential notation for groups just as we do in ordinary algebra. If G is a group and g ∈ G, then we deﬁne g 0 = e. For n ∈ N, we deﬁne gn = g · g · · · g
n times

and g −n = g −1 · g −1 · · · g −1 .
n times

Theorem 2.8 In a group, the usual laws of exponents hold; that is, for all g, h ∈ G, 1. g m g n = g m+n for all m, n ∈ Z; 2. (g m )n = g mn for all m, n ∈ Z; 3. (gh)n = (h−1 g −1 )−n for all n ∈ Z. Furthermore, if G is abelian, then (gh)n = g n hn . We will leave the proof of this theorem as an exercise. Notice that (gh)n = g n hn in general, since the group may not be abelian. If the group is Z or Zn , we write the group operation additively and the exponential operation multiplicatively; that is, we write ng instead of g n . The laws of exponents now become

46 1. mg + ng = (m + n)g for all m, n ∈ Z; 2. m(ng) = (mn)g for all m, n ∈ Z; 3. m(g + h) = mg + mh for all n ∈ Z.

CHAPTER 2

GROUPS

It is important to realize that the last statement can be made only because Z and Zn are commutative groups. Historical Note
Although the ﬁrst clear axiomatic deﬁnition of a group was not given until the late 1800s, group-theoretic methods had been employed before this time in the development of many areas of mathematics, including geometry and the theory of algebraic equations. Joseph-Louis Lagrange used group-theoretic methods in a 1770–1771 memoir to ´ study methods of solving polynomial equations. Later, Evariste Galois (1811–1832) succeeded in developing the mathematics necessary to determine exactly which polynomial equations could be solved in terms of the polynomials’ coeﬃcients. Galois’ primary tool was group theory. The study of geometry was revolutionized in 1872 when Felix Klein proposed that geometric spaces should be studied by examining those properties that are invariant under a transformation of the space. Sophus Lie, a contemporary of Klein, used group theory to study solutions of partial diﬀerential equations. One of the ﬁrst modern treatments of group theory appeared in William Burnside’s The Theory of Groups of Finite Order [1], ﬁrst published in 1897.

2.3

Subgroups

Deﬁnitions and Examples
Sometimes we wish to investigate smaller groups sitting inside a larger group. The set of even integers 2Z = {. . . , −2, 0, 2, 4, . . .} is a group under the operation of addition. This smaller group sits naturally inside of the group of integers under addition. We deﬁne a subgroup H of a group G to be a subset H of G such that when the group operation of G is restricted to H, H is a group in its own right. Observe that every group G with at least two elements will always have at least two subgroups, the subgroup consisting of the identity element alone and the entire group itself. The subgroup H = {e} of a group G is called the trivial subgroup. A subgroup that is a proper subset of G is called a proper subgroup. In many of the examples that we

2.3

SUBGROUPS

47

have investigated up to this point, there exist other subgroups besides the trivial and improper subgroups. Example 10. Consider the set of nonzero real numbers, R∗ , with the group operation of multiplication. The identity of this group is 1 and the inverse of any element a ∈ R∗ is just 1/a. We will show that Q∗ = {p/q : p and q are nonzero integers} is a subgroup of R∗ . The identity of R∗ is 1; however, 1 = 1/1 is the quotient of two nonzero integers. Hence, the identity of R∗ is in Q∗ . Given two elements in Q∗ , say p/q and r/s, their product pr/qs is also in Q∗ . The inverse of any element p/q ∈ Q∗ is again in Q∗ since (p/q)−1 = q/p. Since multiplication in R∗ is associative, multiplication in Q∗ is associative. Example 11. Recall that C∗ is the multiplicative group of nonzero complex numbers. Let H = {1, −1, i, −i}. Then H is a subgroup of C∗ . It is quite easy to verify that H is a group under multiplication and that H ⊂ C∗ . Example 12. Let SL2 (R) be the subset of GL2 (R) consisting of matrices of determinant one; that is, a matrix A= a b c d

is in SL2 (R) exactly when ad − bc = 1. To show that SL2 (R) is a subgroup of the general linear group, we must show that it is a group under matrix multiplication. The 2 × 2 identity matrix is in SL2 (R), as is the inverse of the matrix A: d −b A−1 = . −c a It remains to show that multiplication is closed; that is, that the product of two matrices of determinant one also has determinant one. We will leave this task as an exercise. The group SL2 (R) is called the special linear group. Example 13. It is important to realize that a subset H of a group G can be a group without being a subgroup of G. For H to be a subgroup of G it must inherit G’s binary operation. The set of all 2 × 2 matrices, M2 (R), forms a group under the operation of addition. The 2 × 2 general linear group is a subset of M2 (R) and is a group under matrix multiplication, but it is not a subgroup of M2 (R). If we add two invertible matrices, we do not

48

CHAPTER 2

GROUPS

necessarily obtain another invertible matrix. Observe that 1 0 0 1 + −1 0 0 −1 = 0 0 0 0 ,

but the zero matrix is not in GL2 (R). Example 14. One way of telling whether or not two groups are the same is by examining their subgroups. Other than the trivial subgroup and the group itself, the group Z4 has a single subgroup consisting of the elements 0 and 2. From the group Z2 , we can form another group of four elements as follows. As a set this group is Z2 × Z2 . We perform the group operation coordinatewise; that is, (a, b)+(c, d) = (a+c, b+d). Table 2.5 is an addition table for Z2 ×Z2 . Since there are three nontrivial proper subgroups of Z2 ×Z2 , H1 = {(0, 0), (0, 1)}, H2 = {(0, 0), (1, 0)}, and H3 = {(0, 0), (1, 1)}, Z4 and Z2 × Z2 must be diﬀerent groups. Table 2.5.

Some Subgroup Theorems
Let us examine some criteria for determining exactly when a subset of a group is a subgroup. Proposition 2.9 A subset H of G is a subgroup if and only if it satisﬁes the following conditions. 1. The identity e of G is in H. 2. If h1 , h2 ∈ H, then h1 h2 ∈ H. 3. If h ∈ H, then h−1 ∈ H. Proof. First suppose that H is a subgroup of G. We must show that the three conditions hold. Since H is a group, it must have an identity eH . We must show that eH = e, where e is the identity of G. We know that

EXERCISES

49

eH eH = eH and that eeH = eH e = eH ; hence, eeH = eH eH . By right-hand cancellation, e = eH . The second condition holds since a subgroup H is a group. To prove the third condition, let h ∈ H. Since H is a group, there is an element h ∈ H such that hh = h h = e. By the uniqueness of the inverse in G, h = h−1 . Conversely, if the three conditions hold, we must show that H is a group under the same operation as G; however, these conditions plus the associativity of the binary operation are exactly the axioms stated in the deﬁnition of a group. Proposition 2.10 Let H be a subset of a group G. Then H is a subgroup of G if and only if H = ∅, and whenever g, h ∈ H then gh−1 is in H. Proof. Let H be a nonempty subset of G. Then H contains some element g. So gg −1 = e is in H. If g ∈ H, then eg −1 = g −1 is also in H. Finally, let g, h ∈ H. We must show that their product is also in H. However, g(h−1 )−1 = gh ∈ H. Hence, H is indeed a subgroup of G. Conversely, if g and h are in H, we want to show that gh−1 ∈ H. Since h is in H, its inverse h−1 must also be in H. Because of the closure of the group operation, gh−1 ∈ H.

Additional Exercises: Detecting Errors
Credit card companies, banks, book publishers, and supermarkets all take advantage of the properties of integer arithmetic modulo n and group theory to obtain error detection schemes for the identiﬁcation codes that they use. 1. UPC Symbols. Universal Product Code (UPC) symbols are now found on most products in grocery and retail stores. The UPC symbol is a 12digit code identifying the manufacturer of a product and the product itself (Figure ??). The ﬁrst 11 digits contain information about the product; the twelfth digit is used for error detection. If d1 d2 · · · d12 is a valid UPC number, then 3 · d1 + 1 · d2 + 3 · d3 + · · · + 3 · d11 + 1 · d12 ≡ 0 (mod 10).

(c) Write a formula to calculate the check digit, d12 , in the UPC number.

The tenth digit is a check digit satisfying (d1 , d2 , . . . , d10 ) · (10, 9, . . . , 1) ≡ 0 (mod 11). (mod n)

One problem is that d10 might have to be a 10 to make the inner product zero; in this case, 11 digits would be needed to make this scheme work. Therefore, the character X is used for the eleventh digit. So ISBN 3-540-96035-X is a valid ISBN code. (a) Is ISBN 0-534-91500-0 a valid ISBN code? What about ISBN 0-53491700-0 and ISBN 0-534-19500-0? (b) Does this method detect all single-digit errors? What about all transposition errors?

Cyclic Groups

The groups Z and Zn , which are among the most familiar and easily understood groups, are both examples of what are called cyclic groups. In this chapter we will study the properties of cyclic groups and cyclic subgroups, which play a fundamental part in the classiﬁcation of all abelian groups.

3.1

Cyclic Subgroups

Often a subgroup will depend entirely on a single element of the group; that is, knowing that particular element will allow us to compute any other element in the subgroup. Example 1. Suppose that we consider 3 ∈ Z and look at all multiples (both positive and negative) of 3. As a set, this is 3Z = {. . . , −3, 0, 3, 6, . . .}. It is easy to see that 3Z is a subgroup of the integers. This subgroup is completely determined by the element 3 since we can obtain all of the other elements of the group by taking multiples of 3. Every element in the subgroup is “generated” by 3. Example 2. If H = {2n : n ∈ Z}, then H is a subgroup of the multiplicative group of nonzero rational numbers, Q∗ . If a = 2m and b = 2n are in H, then ab−1 = 2m 2−n = 2m−n is also in H. By Proposition 2.10, H is a subgroup of Q∗ determined by the element 2. Theorem 3.1 Let G be a group and a be any element in G. Then the set a = {ak : k ∈ Z} is a subgroup of G. Furthermore, a is the smallest subgroup of G that contains a. 56

3.1

CYCLIC SUBGROUPS

Proof. The identity is in a since a0 = e. If g and h are any two elements in a , then by the deﬁnition of a we can write g = am and h = an for some integers m and n. So gh = am an = am+n is again in a . Finally, if g = an in a , then the inverse g −1 = a−n is also in a . Clearly, any subgroup H of G containing a must contain all the powers of a by closure; hence, H contains a . Therefore, a is the smallest subgroup of G containing a. Remark. If we are using the “+” notation, as in the case of the integers under addition, we write a = {na : n ∈ Z}. For a ∈ G, we call a the cyclic subgroup generated by a. If G contains some element a such that G = a , then G is a cyclic group. In this case a is a generator of G. If a is an element of a group G, we deﬁne the order of a to be the smallest positive integer n such that an = e, and we write |a| = n. If there is no such integer n, we say that the order of a is inﬁnite and write |a| = ∞ to denote the order of a. Example 3. Notice that a cyclic group can have more than a single generator. Both 1 and 5 generate Z6 ; hence, Z6 is a cyclic group. Not every element in a cyclic group is necessarily a generator of the group. The order of 2 ∈ Z6 is 3. The cyclic subgroup generated by 2 is 2 = {0, 2, 4}. The groups Z and Zn are cyclic groups. The elements 1 and −1 are generators for Z. We can certainly generate Zn with 1 although there may be other generators of Zn , as in the case of Z6 . Example 4. The group of units, U (9), in Z9 is a cyclic group. As a set, U (9) is {1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8}. The element 2 is a generator for U (9) since 21 = 2 23 = 8 25 = 5 22 = 4 24 = 7 26 = 1.

Example 5. Not every group is a cyclic group. Consider the symmetry group of an equilateral triangle S3 . The multiplication table for this group is Table 2.2. The subgroups of S3 are shown in Figure 3.1. Notice that every subgroup is cyclic; however, no single element generates the entire group.

Theorem 3.2 Every cyclic group is abelian.

Subgroups of Cyclic Groups
We can ask some interesting questions about cyclic subgroups of a group and subgroups of a cyclic group. If G is a group, which subgroups of G are cyclic? If G is a cyclic group, what type of subgroups does G possess? Theorem 3.3 Every subgroup of a cyclic group is cyclic. Proof. The main tools used in this proof are the division algorithm and the Principle of Well-Ordering. Let G be a cyclic group generated by a and suppose that H is a subgroup of G. If H = {e}, then trivially H is cyclic. Suppose that H contains some other element g distinct from the identity. Then g can be written as an for some integer n. We can assume that n > 0. Let m be the smallest natural number such that am ∈ H. Such an m exists by the Principle of Well-Ordering. We claim that h = am is a generator for H. We must show that every h ∈ H can be written as a power of h. Since h ∈ H and H is a subgroup of G, h = ak for some positive integer k. Using the division algorithm, we can ﬁnd numbers q and r such that k = mq + r where 0 ≤ r < m; hence, ak = amq+r = (am )q ar = hq ar .

3.1

So ar = ak h−q . Since ak and h−q are in H, ar must also be in H. However, m was the smallest positive number such that am was in H; consequently, r = 0 and so k = mq. Therefore, h = ak = amq = hq and H is generated by h. Corollary 3.4 The subgroups of Z are exactly nZ for n = 0, 1, 2, . . .. Proposition 3.5 Let G be a cyclic group of order n and suppose that a is a generator for G. Then ak = e if and only if n divides k. Proof. First suppose that ak = e. By the division algorithm, k = nq + r where 0 ≤ r < n; hence, e = ak = anq+r = anq ar = ear = ar . Since the smallest positive integer m such that am = e is n, r = 0. Conversely, if n divides k, then k = ns for some integer s. Consequently, ak = ans = (an )s = es = e.

Theorem 3.6 Let G be a cyclic group of order n and suppose that a ∈ G is a generator of the group. If b = ak , then the order of b is n/d, where d = gcd(k, n). Proof. We wish to ﬁnd the smallest integer m such that e = bm = akm . By Proposition 3.5, this is the smallest integer m such that n divides km or, equivalently, n/d divides m(k/d). Since d is the greatest common divisor of n and k, n/d and k/d are relatively prime. Hence, for n/d to divide m(k/d) it must divide m. The smallest such m is n/d. Corollary 3.7 The generators of Zn are the integers r such that 1 ≤ r < n and gcd(r, n) = 1. Example 6. Let us examine the group Z16 . The numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15 are the elements of Z16 that are relatively prime to 16. Each of these elements generates Z16 . For example, 1·9 4·9 7·9 10 · 9 13 · 9 = = = = = 9 4 15 10 5 2·9 5·9 8·9 11 · 9 14 · 9 = = = = = 2 13 8 3 14 3·9 6·9 9·9 12 · 9 15 · 9 = = = = = 11 6 1 12 7.

3.2

The Group C∗
C = {a + bi : a, b ∈ R},

The complex numbers are deﬁned as

where i2 = −1. If z = a + bi, then a is the real part of z and b is the imaginary part of z. To add two complex numbers z = a + bi and w = c + di, we just add the corresponding real and imaginary parts: z + w = (a + bi) + (c + di) = (a + c) + (b + d)i. Remembering that i2 = −1, we multiply complex numbers just like polynomials. The product of z and w is (a + bi)(c + di) = ac + bdi2 + adi + bci = (ac − bd) + (ad + bc)i. Every nonzero complex number z = a + bi has a multiplicative inverse; that is, there exists a z −1 ∈ C∗ such that zz −1 = z −1 z = 1. If z = a + bi, then a − bi z −1 = 2 . a + b2 The complex conjugate of a complex number z = a + bi is deﬁned to be √ z = a − bi. The absolute value or modulus of z = a + bi is |z| = a2 + b2 . Example 7. Let z = 2 + 3i and w = 1 − 2i. Then z + w = (2 + 3i) + (1 − 2i) = 3 + i and zw = (2 + 3i)(1 − 2i) = 8 − i. Also, z −1 = 2 3 − i 13 13 √ |z| = 13 z = 2 − 3i.

There are several ways of graphically representing complex numbers. We can represent a complex number z = a + bi as an ordered pair on the xy

plane where a is the x (or real) coordinate and b is the y (or imaginary) coordinate. This is called the rectangular or Cartesian representation. The rectangular representations of z1 = 2 + 3i, z2 = 1 − 2i, and z3 = −3 + 2i are depicted in Figure 3.2. Nonzero complex numbers can also be represented using polar coordinates. To specify any nonzero point on the plane, it suﬃces to give an angle θ from the positive x axis in the counterclockwise direction and a distance r from the origin, as in Figure 3.3. We can see that z = a + bi = r(cos θ + i sin θ). Hence, r = |z| = a2 + b2

62 and

CHAPTER 3

CYCLIC GROUPS

a = r cos θ b = r sin θ. We sometimes abbreviate r(cos θ + i sin θ) as r cis θ. To assure that the representation of z is well-deﬁned, we also require that 0◦ ≤ θ < 360◦ . If the measurement is in radians, then 0 ≤ θ < 2π. Example 8. Suppose that z = 2 cis 60◦ . Then a = 2 cos 60◦ = 1 and b = 2 sin 60◦ = √ 3.

√ Hence, the rectangular representation is z = 1 + 3 i. Conversely, if we are given a rectangular representation of a complex number, it is often useful to know the number’s polar representation. If √ √ z = 3 2 − 3 2 i, then √ r = a2 + b2 = 36 = 6 and θ = arctan √ √ so 3 2 − 3 2 i = 6 cis 315◦ . b a = arctan(−1) = 315◦ ,

The polar representation of a complex number makes it easy to ﬁnd products and powers of complex numbers. The proof of the following proposition is straightforward and is left as an exercise. Proposition 3.8 Let z = r cis θ and w = s cis φ be two nonzero complex numbers. Then zw = rs cis(θ + φ). Example 9. If z = 3 cis(π/3) and w = 2 cis(π/6), then zw = 6 cis(π/2) = 6i. Theorem 3.9 (DeMoivre) Let z = r cis θ be a nonzero complex number. Then [r cis θ]n = rn cis(nθ) for n = 1, 2, . . ..

3.2

THE GROUP C∗

Proof. We will use induction on n. For n = 1 the theorem is trivial. Assume that the theorem is true for all k such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n. Then z n+1 = z n z = rn (cos nθ + i sin nθ)r(cos θ + i sin θ) = rn+1 [(cos nθ cos θ − sin nθ sin θ) + i(sin nθ cos θ + cos nθ sin θ)] = rn+1 [cos(nθ + θ) + i sin(nθ + θ)] = rn+1 [cos(n + 1)θ + i sin(n + 1)θ].

Example 10. Suppose that z = 1 + i and we wish to compute z 10 . Rather than computing (1 + i)10 directly, it is much easier to switch to polar coordinates and calculate z 10 using DeMoivre’s Theorem: z 10 = (1 + i)10 √ π 10 = 2 cis 4 √ 10 5π = ( 2 ) cis 2 π = 32 cis 2 = 32i.

The Circle Group and the Roots of Unity
The multiplicative group of the complex numbers, C∗ , possesses some interesting subgroups. Whereas Q∗ and R∗ have no interesting subgroups of ﬁnite order, C∗ has many. We ﬁrst consider the circle group, T = {z ∈ C : |z| = 1}. The following proposition is a direct result of Proposition 3.8. Proposition 3.10 The circle group is a subgroup of C∗ . Although the circle group has inﬁnite order, it has many interesting ﬁnite subgroups. Suppose that H = {1, −1, i, −i}. Then H is a subgroup of the circle group. Also, 1, −1, i, and −i are exactly those complex numbers that satisfy the equation z 4 = 1. The complex numbers satisfying the equation z n = 1 are called the nth roots of unity.

64

CHAPTER 3

CYCLIC GROUPS

Theorem 3.11 If z n = 1, then the nth roots of unity are z = cis 2kπ n ,

where k = 0, 1, . . . , n − 1. Furthermore, the nth roots of unity form a cyclic subgroup of T of order n. Proof. By DeMoivre’s Theorem, z n = cis n 2kπ n = cis(2kπ) = 1.

The z’s are distinct since the numbers 2kπ/n are all distinct and are greater than or equal to 0 but less than 2π. The fact that these are all of the roots of the equation z n = 1 follows from the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra (Theorem 19.16), which states that a polynomial of degree n can have at most n roots. We will leave the proof that the nth roots of unity form a cyclic subgroup of T as an exercise. A generator for the group of the nth roots of unity is called a primitive nth root of unity. Example 11. The 8th roots of unity can be represented as eight equally spaced points on the unit circle (Figure 3.4). The primitive 8th roots of unity are √ √ 2 2 ω = + i 2√ 2√ 2 2 + i ω3 = − 2 2 √ √ 2 2 − i ω5 = − 2 √2 √ 2 2 ω7 = − i. 2 2

Computing large powers can be very time-consuming. Just as anyone can compute 22 or 28 , everyone knows how to compute 22

.

However, such numbers are so large that we do not want to attempt the calculations; moreover,past a certain point the computations would not be feasible even if we had every computer in the world at our disposal. Even writing down the decimal representation of a very large number may not be reasonable. It could be thousands or even millions of digits long. However, if we could compute something like 237398332 (mod 46389), we could very easily write the result down since it would be a number between 0 and 46,388. If we want to compute powers modulo n quickly and eﬃciently, we will have to be clever. The ﬁrst thing to notice is that any number a can be written as the sum of distinct powers of 2; that is, we can write a = 2k1 + 2k2 + · · · + 2kn , where k1 < k2 < · · · < kn . This is just the binary representation of a. For example, the binary representation of 57 is 111001, since we can write 57 = 20 + 23 + 24 + 25 . The laws of exponents still work in Zn ; that is, if b ≡ ax (mod n) and k c ≡ ay (mod n), then bc ≡ ax+y (mod n). We can compute a2 (mod n) in

Permutation Groups

Permutation groups are central to the study of geometric symmetries and to Galois theory, the study of ﬁnding solutions of polynomial equations. They also provide abundant examples of nonabelian groups. Let us recall for a moment the symmetries of the equilateral triangle ABC from Chapter 2. The symmetries actually consist of permutations of the three vertices, where a permutation of the set S = {A, B, C} is a one-to-one and onto map π : S → S. The three vertices have the following six permutations. A B C A B C A B C A C B We have used the array A B C B C A to denote the permutation that sends A to B, B to C, and C to A. That is, A → B B → C C → A. The symmetries of a triangle form a group. In this chapter we will study groups of this type. 72 A B C C A B A B C C B A A B C B C A A B C B A C

Deﬁnitions and Notation

In general, the permutations of a set X form a group SX . If X is a ﬁnite set, we can assume X = {1, 2, . . . , n}. In this case we write Sn instead of SX . The following theorem says that Sn is a group. We call this group the symmetric group on n letters. Theorem 4.1 The symmetric group on n letters, Sn , is a group with n! elements, where the binary operation is the composition of maps. Proof. The identity of Sn is just the identity map that sends 1 to 1, 2 to 2, . . ., n to n. If f : Sn → Sn is a permutation, then f −1 exists, since f is one-to-one and onto; hence, every permutation has an inverse. Composition of maps is associative, which makes the group operation associative. We leave the proof that |Sn | = n! as an exercise. A subgroup of Sn is called a permutation group. Example 1. Consider the subgroup G of S5 consisting of the identity permutation id and the permutations σ = τ = 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 5 4 1 2 3 4 5 3 2 1 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 3 2 1 5 4 .

The following table tells us how to multiply elements in the permutation group G. ◦ id σ τ µ id id σ τ µ σ σ id µ τ τ τ µ id σ µ µ τ σ id

Remark. Though it is natural to multiply elements in a group from left to right, functions are composed from right to left. Let σ and τ be permutations on a set X. To compose σ and τ as functions, we calculate (σ ◦ τ )(x) = σ(τ (x)). That is, we do τ ﬁrst, then σ. There are several ways to approach

PERMUTATION GROUPS

this inconsistency. We will adopt the convention of multiplying permutations right to left. To compute στ , do τ ﬁrst and then σ. That is, by στ (x) we mean σ(τ (x)). (Another way of solving this problem would be to write functions on the right; that is, instead of writing σ(x), we could write (x)σ. We could also multiply permutations left to right to agree with the usual way of multiplying elements in a group. Certainly all of these methods have been used. Example 2. Permutation multiplication is not usually commutative. Let σ = τ Then στ = but τσ = 1 2 3 4 3 2 1 4 . 1 2 3 4 1 4 3 2 , = 1 2 3 4 4 1 2 3 1 2 3 4 2 1 4 3 .

Cycle Notation
The notation that we have used to represent permutations up to this point is cumbersome, to say the least. To work eﬀectively with permutation groups, we need a more streamlined method of writing down and manipulating permutations. A permutation σ ∈ SX is a cycle of length k if there exist elements a1 , a2 , . . . , ak ∈ X such that σ(a1 ) = a2 σ(a2 ) = a3 . . . σ(ak ) = a1 and σ(x) = x for all other elements x ∈ X. We will write (a1 , a2 , . . . , ak ) to denote the cycle σ. Cycles are the building blocks of all permutations.

Example 3. The permutation σ= 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 6 3 5 1 4 2 7 = (162354)

is a cycle of length 6, whereas τ= 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 4 2 3 5 6 = (243)

is a cycle of length 3. Not every permutation is a cycle. Consider the permutation 1 2 3 4 5 6 2 4 1 3 6 5 = (1243)(56).

This permutation actually contains a cycle of length 2 and a cycle of length 4. Example 4. It is very easy to compute products of cycles. Suppose that σ = (1352) τ We can think of σ as 1 → 3 3 → 5 5 → 2 2 → 1 and τ as 2 → 5 5 → 6 6 → 2 Hence, στ = (1356). If µ = (1634), then σµ = (1652)(34). Two cycles in SX , σ = (a1 , a2 , . . . , ak ) and τ = (b1 , b2 , . . . , bl ), are disjoint if ai = bj for all i and j. = (256).

76

CHAPTER 4

PERMUTATION GROUPS

Example 5. The cycles (135) and (27) are disjoint; however, the cycles (135) and (347) are not. Calculating their products, we ﬁnd that (135)(27) = (135)(27) (135)(347) = (13475). The product of two cycles that are not disjoint may reduce to something less complicated; the product of disjoint cycles cannot be simpliﬁed. Proposition 4.2 Let σ and τ be two disjoint cycles in SX . Then στ = τ σ. Proof. Let σ = (a1 , a2 , . . . , ak ) and τ = (b1 , b2 , . . . , bl ). We must show that στ (x) = τ σ(x) for all x ∈ X. If x is neither {a1 , a2 , . . . , ak } nor {b1 , b2 , . . . , bl }, then both σ and τ ﬁx x. That is, σ(x) = x and τ (x) = x. Hence, στ (x) = σ(τ (x)) = σ(x) = x = τ (x) = τ (σ(x)) = τ σ(x). Do not forget that we are multiplying permutations right to left, which is the opposite of the order in which we usually multiply group elements. Now suppose that x ∈ {a1 , a2 , . . . , ak }. Then σ(ai ) = a(i mod k)+1 ; that is, a1 → a2 a2 → a3 . . . ak−1 → ak ak → a1 . However, τ (ai ) = ai since σ and τ are disjoint. Therefore, στ (ai ) = σ(τ (ai )) = σ(ai ) = a(i mod k)+1 = τ (a(i mod k)+1 ) = τ (σ(ai )) = τ σ(ai ). Similarly, if x ∈ {b1 , b2 , . . . , bl }, then σ and τ also commute. Theorem 4.3 Every permutation in Sn can be written as the product of disjoint cycles. Proof. We can assume that X = {1, 2, . . . , n}. Let σ ∈ Sn , and deﬁne X1 to be {σ(1), σ 2 (1), . . .}. The set X1 is ﬁnite since X is ﬁnite. Now let i be the ﬁrst integer in X that is not in X1 and deﬁne X2 by {σ(i), σ 2 (i), . . .}. Again, X2 is a ﬁnite set. Continuing in this manner, we can deﬁne ﬁnite

4.1

disjoint sets X3 , X4 , . . .. Since X is a ﬁnite set, we are guaranteed that this process will end and there will be only a ﬁnite number of these sets, say r. If σi is the cycle deﬁned by σi (x) = σ(x) x ∈ Xi x x ∈ Xi , /

then σ = σ1 σ2 · · · σr . Since the sets X1 , X2 , . . . , Xr are disjoint, the cycles σ1 , σ2 , . . . , σr must also be disjoint. Example 6. Let σ = τ = 1 2 3 4 5 6 6 4 3 1 5 2 1 2 3 4 5 6 3 2 1 5 6 4 .

Using cycle notation, we can write σ = (1624) τ στ = (13)(456) = (136)(245)

τ σ = (143)(256).

Remark. From this point forward we will ﬁnd it convenient to use cycle notation to represent permutations. When using cycle notation, we often denote the identity permutation by (1).

Transpositions
The simplest permutation is a cycle of length 2. Such cycles are called transpositions. Since (a1 , a2 , . . . , an ) = (a1 an )(a1 an−1 ) · · · (a1 a3 )(a1 a2 ), any cycle can be written as the product of transpositions, leading to the following proposition. Proposition 4.4 Any permutation of a ﬁnite set containing at least two elements can be written as the product of transpositions.

78

CHAPTER 4

PERMUTATION GROUPS

Example 7. Consider the permutation (16)(253) = (16)(23)(25) = (16)(45)(23)(45)(25). As we can see, there is no unique way to represent permutation as the product of transpositions. For instance, we can write the identity permutation as (12)(12), as (13)(24)(13)(24), and in many other ways. However, as it turns out, no permutation can be written as the product of both an even number of transpositions and an odd number of transpositions. For instance, we could represent the permutation (16) by (23)(16)(23) or by (35)(16)(13)(16)(13)(35)(56), but (16) will always be the product of an odd number of transpositions. Lemma 4.5 If the identity is written as the product of r transpositions, id = τ1 τ2 · · · τr , then r is an even number. Proof. We will employ induction on r. A transposition cannot be the identity; hence, r > 1. If r = 2, then we are done. Suppose that r > 2. In this case the product of the last two transpositions, τr−1 τr , must be one of the following cases: (ab)(ab) = id (bc)(ab) = (ab)(ac) (cd)(ab) = (ab)(cd) (bc)(ac) = (ab)(bc). The ﬁrst equation simply says that a transposition is its own inverse. If this case occurs, delete τr−1 τr from the product to obtain id = τ1 τ2 · · · τr−3 τr−2 . By induction r − 2 is even; hence, r must be even. In each of the other three cases, we can replace τr−1 τr with the right-hand side of the corresponding equation to obtain a new product of r transpositions for the identity. In this new product the last occurrence of a will

4.1

DEFINITIONS AND NOTATION

79

be in the next-to-the-last transposition. We can continue this process with τr−2 τr−1 to obtain either a product of r − 2 transpositions or a new product of r transpositions where the last occurrence of a is in τr−2 . If the identity is the product of r −2 transpositions, then again we are done, by our induction hypothesis; otherwise, we will repeat the procedure with τr−3 τr−2 . At some point either we will have two adjacent, identical transpositions canceling each other out or a will be shuﬄed so that it will appear only in the ﬁrst transposition. However, the latter case cannot occur, because the identity would not ﬁx a in this instance. Therefore, the identity permutation must be the product of r − 2 transpositions and, again by our induction hypothesis, we are done. Theorem 4.6 If a permutation σ can be expressed as the product of an even number of transpositions, then any other product of transpositions equaling σ must also contain an even number of transpositions. Similarly, if σ can be expressed as the product of an odd number of transpositions, then any other product of transpositions equaling σ must also contain an odd number of transpositions. Proof. Suppose that σ = σ1 σ2 · · · σm = τ1 τ2 · · · τn , where m is even. We must show that n is also an even number. The inverse of σ −1 is σm · · · σ1 . Since id = σσm · · · σ1 = τ1 · · · τn σm · · · σ1 , n must be even by Lemma 4.5. The proof for the case in which σ can be expressed as an odd number of transpositions is left as an exercise. In light of Theorem 4.6, we deﬁne a permutation to be even if it can be expressed as an even number of transpositions and odd if it can be expressed as an odd number of transpositions.

The Alternating Groups
One of the most important subgroups of Sn is the set of all even permutations, An . The group An is called the alternating group on n letters. Theorem 4.7 The set An is a subgroup of Sn .

80

CHAPTER 4

PERMUTATION GROUPS

Proof. Since the product of two even permutations must also be an even permutation, An is closed. The identity is an even permutation and therefore is in An . If σ is an even permutation, then σ = σ1 σ2 · · · σr , where σi is a transposition and r is even. Since the inverse of any transposition is itself, σ −1 = σr σr−1 · · · σ1 is also in An . Proposition 4.8 The number of even permutations in Sn , n ≥ 2, is equal to the number of odd permutations; hence, the order of An is n!/2. Proof. Let An be the set of even permutations in Sn and Bn be the set of odd permutations. If we can show that there is a bijection between these sets, they must contain the same number of elements. Fix a transposition σ in Sn . Since n ≥ 2, such a σ exists. Deﬁne λ σ : An → B n by λσ (τ ) = στ. Suppose that λσ (τ ) = λσ (µ). Then στ = σµ and so τ = σ −1 στ = σ −1 σµ = µ. Therefore, λσ is one-to-one. We will leave the proof that λσ is surjective to the reader. Example 8. The group A4 is the subgroup of S4 consisting of even permutations. There are twelve elements in A4 : (1) (12)(34) (13)(24) (14)(23) (123) (132) (124) (142) (134) (143) (234) (243). One of the end-of-chapter exercises will be to write down all the subgroups of A4 . You will ﬁnd that there is no subgroup of order 6. Does this surprise you?

THE DIHEDRAL GROUPS

81

Lagrange ﬁrst thought of permutations as functions from a set to itself, but it was Cauchy who developed the basic theorems and notation for permutations. He was the ﬁrst to use cycle notation. Augustin-Louis Cauchy (1789–1857) was born in Paris at the height of the French Revolution. His family soon left Paris for the village of Arcueil to escape the Reign of Terror. One of the family’s neighbors there was Pierre-Simon Laplace (1749–1827), who encouraged him to seek a career in mathematics. Cauchy began his career as a mathematician by solving a problem in geometry given to him by Lagrange. Over 800 papers were written by Cauchy on such diverse topics as diﬀerential equations, ﬁnite groups, applied mathematics, and complex analysis. He was one of the mathematicians responsible for making calculus rigorous. Perhaps more theorems and concepts in mathematics have the name Cauchy attached to them than that of any other mathematician.

The Dihedral Groups

Another special type of permutation group is the dihedral group. Recall the symmetry group of an equilateral triangle in Chapter 2. Such groups consist of the rigid motions of a regular n-sided polygon or n-gon. For n = 3, 4, . . ., we deﬁne the nth dihedral group to be the group of rigid motions of a regular n-gon. We will denote this group by Dn . We can number the vertices of a regular n-gon by 1, 2, . . . , n (Figure 4.1). Notice that there are exactly n choices to replace the ﬁrst vertex. If we replace the ﬁrst vertex by k, then the second vertex must be replaced either by vertex k + 1 or by vertex k − 1; hence, there are 2n possible rigid motions of the n-gon. We summarize these

results in the following theorem. Theorem 4.9 The dihedral group, Dn , is a subgroup of Sn of order 2n.

The possible motions of a regular n-gon are either reﬂections or rotations (Figure 4.2). There are exactly n possible rotations: id, 360◦ 360◦ 360◦ ,2 · , . . . , (n − 1) · . n n n

We will denote the rotation 360◦ /n by r. The rotation r generates all of the other rotations. That is, 360◦ rk = k · . n Label the n reﬂections s1 , s2 , . . . , sn , where sk is the reﬂection that leaves vertex k ﬁxed. There are two cases of reﬂection, depending on whether n is even or odd. If there are an even number of vertices, then 2 vertices are left ﬁxed by a reﬂection. If there are an odd number of vertices, then only a single vertex is left ﬁxed by a reﬂection (Figure 4.3). Hence, if n = 2m for some integer m, then si = si+m for 1 ≤ i < m. The order of sk is two. Let s = s1 . Then s2 = id and rn = id. Since any rigid motion t of the n-gon replaces the ﬁrst vertex by the vertex k, the second vertex must be replaced by either k + 1 or by k − 1. If it is replaced by k + 1, then t = rk . If it is replaced by k − 1, then t = rk s. Hence, r and s generate Dn ; that is, Dn consists of all ﬁnite products of r and s. We will leave the proof that srs = r−1 as an exercise.

The Motion Group of a Cube
We can investigate the groups of rigid motions of geometric objects other than a regular n-sided polygon to obtain interesting examples of permutation groups. Let us consider the group of rigid motions of a cube. One of the ﬁrst questions that we can ask about this group is “what is its order?” A cube has 6 sides. If a particular side is facing upward, then there are four possible rotations of the cube that will preserve the upward-facing side. Hence, the order of the group is 6·4 = 24. We have just proved the following proposition. Proposition 4.11 The group of rigid motions of a cube contains 24 elements. Theorem 4.12 The group of rigid motions of a cube is S4 .

Figure 4.6. Transpositions in the motion group of a cube

Proof. From Proposition 4.11, we already know that the motion group of the cube has 24 elements, the same number of elements as there are in S4 . There are exactly four diagonals in the cube. If we label these diagonals 1, 2, 3, and 4, we must show that the motion group of the cube will give us any permutation of the diagonals (Figure 4.5). If we can obtain all of these permutations, then S4 and the group of rigid motions of the cube must be the same. To obtain a transposition we can rotate the cube 180◦ about the axis joining the midpoints of opposite edges (Figure 4.6). There are six such axes, giving all transpositions in S4 . Since every element in S4 is the product of a ﬁnite number of transpositions, the motion group of a cube must be S4 .

Cosets and Lagrange’s Theorem

Lagrange’s Theorem, one of the most important results in ﬁnite group theory, states that the order of a subgroup must divide the order of the group. This theorem provides a powerful tool for analyzing ﬁnite groups; it gives us an idea of exactly what type of subgroups we might expect a ﬁnite group to possess. Central to understanding Lagranges’s Theorem is the notion of a coset.

5.1

Cosets

Let G be a group and H a subgroup of G. Deﬁne a left coset of H with representative g ∈ G to be the set gH = {gh : h ∈ H}. Right cosets can be deﬁned similarly by Hg = {hg : h ∈ H}. If left and right cosets coincide or if it is clear from the context to which type of coset that we are referring, we will use the word coset without specifying left or right. Example 1. Let H be the subgroup of Z6 consisting of the elements 0 and 3. The cosets are 0 + H = 3 + H = {0, 3} 1 + H = 4 + H = {1, 4} 2 + H = 5 + H = {2, 5}. 89

CHAPTER 5

COSETS AND LAGRANGE’S THEOREM

We will always write the cosets of subgroups of Z and Zn with the additive notation we have used for cosets here. In a commutative group, left and right cosets are always identical. Example 2. Let H be the subgroup of S3 deﬁned by the permutations {(1), (123), (132)}. The left cosets of H are (1)H = (123)H = (132)H = {(1), (123), (132)} (12)H = (13)H = (23)H = {(12), (13), (23)}. The right cosets of H are exactly the same as the left cosets: H(1) = H(123) = H(132) = {(1), (123), (132)} H(12) = H(13) = H(23) = {(12), (13), (23)}. It is not always the case that a left coset is the same as a right coset. Let K be the subgroup of S3 deﬁned by the permutations {(1), (12)}. Then the left cosets of K are (1)K = (12)K = {(1), (12)} (13)K = (123)K = {(13), (123)} (23)K = (132)K = {(23), (132)}; however, the right cosets of K are K(1) = K(12) = {(1), (12)} K(13) = K(132) = {(13), (132)} K(23) = K(123) = {(23), (123)}.

The following lemma is quite useful when dealing with cosets. (We leave its proof as an exercise.) Lemma 5.1 Let H be a subgroup of a group G and suppose that g1 , g2 ∈ G. The following conditions are equivalent. 1. g1 H = g2 H;
−1 −1 2. Hg1 = Hg2 ;

3. g1 H ⊆ g2 H;

4. g2 ∈ g1 H;
−1 5. g1 g2 ∈ H.

In all of our examples the cosets of a subgroup H partition the larger group G. The following theorem proclaims that this will always be the case. Theorem 5.2 Let H be a subgroup of a group G. Then the left cosets of H in G partition G. That is, the group G is the disjoint union of the left cosets of H in G. Proof. Let g1 H and g2 H be two cosets of H in G. We must show that either g1 H ∩ g2 H = ∅ or g1 H = g2 H. Suppose that g1 H ∩ g2 H = ∅ and a ∈ g1 H ∩ g2 H. Then by the deﬁnition of a left coset, a = g1 h1 = g2 h2 for some elements h1 and h2 in H. Hence, g1 = g2 h2 h−1 or g1 ∈ g2 H. By 1 Lemma 5.1, g1 H = g2 H. Remark. There is nothing special in this theorem about left cosets. Right cosets also partition G; the proof of this fact is exactly the same as the proof for left cosets except that all group multiplications are done on the opposite side of H. Let G be a group and H be a subgroup of G. Deﬁne the index of H in G to be the number of left cosets of H in G. We will denote the index by [G : H]. Example 3. Let G = Z6 and H = {0, 3}. Then [G : H] = 3. Example 4. Suppose that G = S3 , H = {(1), (123), (132)}, and K = {(1), (12)}. Then [G : H] = 2 and [G : K] = 3. Theorem 5.3 Let H be a subgroup of a group G. The number of left cosets of H in G is the same as the number of right cosets of H in G. Proof. Let LH and RH denote the set of left and right cosets of H in G, respectively. If we can deﬁne a bijective map φ : LH → RH , then the theorem will be proved. If gH ∈ LH , let φ(gH) = Hg −1 . By Lemma 5.1, −1 −1 the map φ is well-deﬁned; that is, if g1 H = g2 H, then Hg1 = Hg2 . To show that φ is one-to-one, suppose that
−1 −1 Hg1 = φ(g1 H) = φ(g2 H) = Hg2 .

Again by Lemma 5.1, g1 H = g2 H. The map φ is onto since φ(g −1 H) = Hg.

Lagrange’s Theorem

Proposition 5.4 Let H be a subgroup of G with g ∈ G and deﬁne a map φ : H → gH by φ(h) = gh. The map φ is bijective; hence, the number of elements in H is the same as the number of elements in gH. Proof. We ﬁrst show that the map φ is one-to-one. Suppose that φ(h1 ) = φ(h2 ) for elements h1 , h2 ∈ H. We must show that h1 = h2 , but φ(h1 ) = gh1 and φ(h2 ) = gh2 . So gh1 = gh2 , and by left cancellation h1 = h2 . To show that φ is onto is easy. By deﬁnition every element of gH is of the form gh for some h ∈ H and φ(h) = gh. Theorem 5.5 (Lagrange) Let G be a ﬁnite group and let H be a subgroup of G. Then |G|/|H| = [G : H] is the number of distinct left cosets of H in G. In particular, the number of elements in H must divide the number of elements in G. Proof. The group G is partitioned into [G : H] distinct left cosets. Each left coset has |H| elements; therefore, |G| = [G : H]|H|. Corollary 5.6 Suppose that G is a ﬁnite group and g ∈ G. Then the order of g must divide the number of elements in G. Corollary 5.7 Let |G| = p with p a prime number. Then G is cyclic and any g ∈ G such that g = e is a generator. Proof. Let g be in G such that g = e. Then by Corollary 5.6, the order of g must divide the order of the group. Since | g | > 1, it must be p. Hence, g generates G. Corollary 5.7 suggests that groups of prime order p must somehow look like Zp . Corollary 5.8 Let H and K be subgroups of a ﬁnite group G such that G ⊃ H ⊃ K. Then [G : K] = [G : H][H : K]. Proof. Observe that [G : K] = |G| |G| |H| = · = [G : H][H : K]. |K| |H| |K|

5.2

LAGRANGE’S THEOREM

93

The converse of Lagrange’s Theorem is false. The group A4 has order 12; however, it can be shown that it does not possess a subgroup of order 6. According to Lagrange’s Theorem, subgroups of a group of order 12 can have orders of either 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6. However, we are not guaranteed that subgroups of every possible order exist. To prove that A4 has no subgroup of order 6, we will assume that it does have a subgroup H such that |H| = 6 and show that a contradiction must occur. The group A4 contains eight 3-cycles; hence, H must contain a 3-cycle. We will show that if H contains one 3-cycle, then it must contain every 3-cycle, contradicting the assumption that H has only 6 elements. Theorem 5.9 Two cycles τ and µ in Sn have the same length if and only if there exists a σ ∈ Sn such that µ = στ σ −1 . Proof. Suppose that τ = (a1 , a2 , . . . , ak )

µ = (b1 , b2 , . . . , bk ). Deﬁne σ to be the permutation σ(a1 ) = b1 σ(a2 ) = b2 . . . σ(ak ) = bk . Then µ = στ σ −1 . Conversely, suppose that τ = (a1 , a2 , . . . , ak ) is a k-cycle and σ ∈ Sn . If σ(ai ) = b and σ(a(i mod k)+1 ) = b , then µ(b) = b . Hence, µ = (σ(a1 ), σ(a2 ), . . . , σ(ak )). Since σ is one-to-one and onto, µ is a cycle of the same length as τ . Corollary 5.10 The group A4 has no subgroup of order 6. Proof. Since [A4 : H] = 2, there are only two cosets of H in A4 . Inasmuch as one of the cosets is H itself, right and left cosets must coincide; therefore, gH = Hg or gHg −1 = H for every g ∈ A4 . By Theorem 5.9, if H contains one 3-cycle, then it must contain every 3-cycle, contradicting the order of H.

Fermat’s and Euler’s Theorems

The Euler φ-function is the map φ : N → N deﬁned by φ(n) = 1 for n = 1, and, for n > 1, φ(n) is the number of positive integers m with 1 ≤ m < n and gcd(m, n) = 1. From Proposition 2.1, we know that the order of U (n), the group of units in Zn , is φ(n). For example, |U (12)| = φ(12) = 4 since the numbers that are relatively prime to 12 are 1, 5, 7, and 11. For any prime p, φ(p) = p − 1. We state these results in the following theorem. Theorem 5.11 Let U (n) be the group of units in Zn . Then |U (n)| = φ(n). The following theorem is an important result in number theory, due to Leonhard Euler. Theorem 5.12 (Euler’s Theorem) Let a and n be integers such that n > 0 and gcd(a, n) = 1. Then aφ(n) ≡ 1 (mod n). Proof. By Theorem 5.11 the order of U (n) is φ(n). Consequently, aφ(n) = 1 for all a ∈ U (n); or aφ(n) − 1 is divisible by n. Therefore, aφ(n) ≡ 1 (mod n). If we consider the special case of Euler’s Theorem in which n = p is prime and recall that φ(p) = p − 1, we obtain the following result, due to Pierre de Fermat. Theorem 5.13 (Fermat’s Little Theorem) Let p be any prime number and suppose that p | a. Then ap−1 ≡ 1 (mod p).

Furthermore, for any integer b, bp ≡ b (mod p).

Historical Note
Joseph-Louis Lagrange (1736–1813), born in Turin, Italy, was of French and Italian descent. His talent for mathematics became apparent at an early age. Leonhard Euler recognized Lagrange’s abilities when Lagrange, who was only 19, communicated to Euler some work that he had done in the calculus of variations. That year he was also named a professor at the Royal Artillery School in Turin. At the age of 23 he joined the Berlin Academy. Frederick the Great had written to Lagrange

proclaiming that the “greatest king in Europe” should have the “greatest mathematician in Europe” at his court. For 20 years Lagrange held the position vacated by his mentor, Euler. His works include contributions to number theory, group theory, physics and mechanics, the calculus of variations, the theory of equations, and diﬀerential equations. Along with Laplace and Lavoisier, Lagrange was one of the people responsible for designing the metric system. During his life Lagrange profoundly inﬂuenced the development of mathematics, leaving much to the next generation of mathematicians in the form of examples and new problems to be solved.

Introduction to Cryptography

Cryptography is the study of sending and receiving secret messages. The aim of cryptography is to send messages across a channel so only the intended recipient of the message can read it. In addition, when a message is received, the recipient usually requires some assurance that the message is authentic; that is, that it has not been sent by someone who is trying to deceive the recipient. Modern cryptography is heavily dependent on abstract algebra and number theory. The message to be sent is called the plaintext message. The disguised message is called the ciphertext. The plaintext and the ciphertext are both written in an alphabet, consisting of letters or characters. Characters can include not only the familiar alphabetic characters A, . . ., Z and a, . . ., z but also digits, punctuation marks, and blanks. A cryptosystem, or cipher, has two parts: encryption, the process of transforming a plaintext message to a ciphertext message, and decryption, the reverse transformation of changing a ciphertext message into a plaintext message. There are many diﬀerent families of cryptosystems, each distinguished by a particular encryption algorithm. Cryptosystems in a speciﬁed cryptographic family are distinguished from one another by a parameter to the encryption function called a key. A classical cryptosystem has a single key, which must be kept secret, known only to the sender and the receiver of the message. If person A wishes to send secret messages to two diﬀerent people B and C, and does not wish to have B understand C’s messages or vice versa, A must use two separate keys, so one cryptosystem is used for exchanging messages with B, and another is used for exchanging messages with C. 97

98

CHAPTER 6

INTRODUCTION TO CRYPTOGRAPHY

Systems that use two separate keys, one for encoding and another for decoding, are called public key cryptosystems. Since knowledge of the encoding key does not allow anyone to guess at the decoding key, the encoding key can be made public. A public key cryptosystem allows A and B to send messages to C using the same encoding key. Anyone is capable of encoding a message to be sent to C, but only C knows how to decode such a message.

6.1

Private Key Cryptography

In single or private key cryptosystems the same key is used for both encrypting and decrypting messages. To encrypt a plaintext message, we apply to the message some function which is kept secret, say f . This function will yield an encrypted message. Given the encrypted form of the message, we can recover the original message by applying the inverse transformation f −1 . The transformation f must be relatively easy to compute, as must f −1 ; however, f must be extremely diﬃcult to guess at if only examples of coded messages are available. Example 1. One of the ﬁrst and most famous private key cryptosystems was the shift code used by Julius Caesar. We ﬁrst digitize the alphabet by letting A = 00, B = 01, . . . , Z = 25. The encoding function will be f (p) = p + 3 mod 26; that is, A → D, B → E, . . . , Z → C. The decoding function is then f −1 (p) = p − 3 mod 26 = p + 23 mod 26. Suppose we receive the encoded message DOJHEUD. To decode this message, we ﬁrst digitize it: 3, 14, 9, 7, 4, 20, 3. Next we apply the inverse transformation to get 0, 11, 6, 4, 1, 17, 0, or ALGEBRA. Notice here that there is nothing special about either of the numbers 3 or 26. We could have used a larger alphabet or a diﬀerent shift. Cryptanalysis is concerned with deciphering a received or intercepted message. Methods from probability and statistics are great aids in deciphering an intercepted message; for example, the frequency analysis of the

6.1

PRIVATE KEY CRYPTOGRAPHY

99

characters appearing in the intercepted message often makes its decryption possible. Example 2. Suppose we receive a message that we know was encrypted by using a shift transformation on single letters of the 26-letter alphabet. To ﬁnd out exactly what the shift transformation was, we must compute b in the equation f (p) = p + b mod 26. We can do this using frequency analysis. The letter E = 04 is the most commonly occurring letter in the English language. Suppose that S = 18 is the most commonly occurring letter in the ciphertext. Then we have good reason to suspect that 18 = 4+b mod 26, or b = 14. Therefore, the most likely encrypting function is f (p) = p + 14 mod 26. The corresponding decrypting function is f −1 (p) = p + 12 mod 26. It is now easy to determine whether or not our guess is correct. Simple shift codes are examples of monoalphabetic cryptosystems. In these ciphers a character in the enciphered message represents exactly one character in the original message. Such cryptosystems are not very sophisticated and are quite easy to break. In fact, in a simple shift as described in Example 1, there are only 26 possible keys. It would be quite easy to try them all rather than to use frequency analysis. Let us investigate a slightly more sophisticated cryptosystem. Suppose that the encoding function is given by f (p) = ap + b mod 26. We ﬁrst need to ﬁnd out when a decoding function f −1 exists. Such a decoding function exists when we can solve the equation c = ap + b mod 26 for p. By Proposition 2.1, this is possible exactly when a has an inverse or, equivalently, when gcd(a, 26) = 1. In this case f −1 (p) = a−1 p − a−1 b mod 26. Such a cryptosystem is called an aﬃne cryptosystem. Example 3. Let us consider the aﬃne cryptosystem f (p) = ap + b mod 26. For this cryptosystem to work we must choose an a ∈ Z26 that is invertible.

100

CHAPTER 6

INTRODUCTION TO CRYPTOGRAPHY

This is only possible if gcd(a, 26) = 1. Recognizing this fact, we will let a = 5 since gcd(5, 26) = 1. It is easy to see that a−1 = 21. Therefore, we can take our encryption function to be f (p) = 5p + 3 mod 26. Thus, ALGEBRA is encoded as 3, 6, 7, 23, 8, 10, 3, or DGHXIKD. The decryption function will be f −1 (p) = 21p − 21 · 3 mod 26 = 21p + 15 mod 26.

A cryptosystem would be more secure if a ciphertext letter could represent more than one plaintext letter. To give an example of this type of cryptosystem, called a polyalphabetic cryptosystem, we will generalize aﬃne codes by using matrices. The idea works roughly the same as before; however, instead of encrypting one letter at a time we will encrypt pairs of letters. We can store a pair of letters p1 and p2 in a vector p= p1 p2 .

Let A be a 2 × 2 invertible matrix with entries in Z26 . We can deﬁne an encoding function by f (p) = Ap + b, where b is a ﬁxed column vector and matrix operations are performed in Z26 . The decoding function must be f −1 (p) = A−1 p − A−1 b. Example 4. Suppose that we wish to encode the word HELP. The corresponding digit string is 7, 4, 11, 15. If A= then A−1 = 2 21 25 3 . 3 5 1 2 ,

If b = (2, 2)t , then our message is encrypted as RRCR. The encrypted letter R represents more than one plaintext letter. Frequency analysis can still be performed on a polyalphabetic cryptosystem, because we have a good understanding of how pairs of letters appear in the English language. The pair th appears quite often; the pair qz never appears. To avoid decryption by a third party, we must use a larger matrix than the one we used in Example 4.

6.2

Public Key Cryptography

If traditional cryptosystems are used, anyone who knows enough to encode a message will also know enough to decode an intercepted message. In 1976, W. Diﬃe and M. Hellman proposed public key cryptography, which is based on the observation that the encryption and decryption procedures need not have the same key. This removes the requirement that the encoding key be kept secret. The encoding function f must be relatively easy to compute, but f −1 must be extremely diﬃcult to compute without some additional information, so that someone who knows only the encrypting key cannot ﬁnd the decrypting key without prohibitive computation. It is interesting to note that to date, no system has been proposed that has been proven to be “one-way;” that is, for any existing public key cryptosystem, it has never been shown to be computationally prohibitive to decode messages with only knowledge of the encoding key.

The RSA Cryptosystem
The RSA cryptosystem introduced by R. Rivest, A. Shamir, and L. Adleman in 1978, is based on the diﬃculty of factoring large numbers. Though it is not a diﬃcult task to ﬁnd two large random primes and multiply them together, factoring a 150-digit number that is the product of two large primes would take 100 million computers operating at 10 million instructions per second about 50 million years under the fastest algorithms currently known. The RSA cryptosystem works as follows. Suppose that we choose two random 150-digit prime numbers p and q. Next, we compute the product n = pq and also compute φ(n) = m = (p − 1)(q − 1), where φ is the Euler φ-function. Now we start choosing random integers E until we ﬁnd one that is relatively prime to m; that is, we choose E such that gcd(E, m) = 1. Using the Euclidean algorithm, we can ﬁnd a number D such that DE ≡ 1 (mod m). The numbers n and E are now made public. Suppose now that person B (Bob) wishes to send person A (Alice) a message over a public line. Since E and n are known to everyone, anyone can encode messages. Bob ﬁrst digitizes the message according to some scheme, say A = 00, B = 02, . . . , Z = 25. If necessary, he will break the message into pieces such that each piece is a positive integer less than n. Suppose x is one of the pieces. Bob forms the number y = xE mod n and sends y to Alice. For Alice to recover x, she need only compute x = y D mod n. Only Alice knows D.

102

CHAPTER 6

INTRODUCTION TO CRYPTOGRAPHY

Example 5. Before exploring the theory behind the RSA cryptosystem or attempting to use large integers, we will use some small integers just to see that the system does indeed work. Suppose that we wish to send some message, which when digitized is 23. Let p = 23 and q = 29. Then n = pq = 667 and φ(n) = m = (p − 1)(q − 1) = 616. We can let E = 487, since gcd(616, 487) = 1. The encoded message is computed to be 23487 mod 667 = 368. This computation can be reasonably done by using the method of repeated squares as described in Chapter 3. Using the Euclidean algorithm, we determine that 191E = 1 + 151m; therefore, the decrypting key is (n, D) = (667, 191). We can recover the original message by calculating 368191 mod 667 = 23.

Now let us examine why the RSA cryptosystem works. We know that DE ≡ 1 (mod m); hence, there exists a k such that DE = km + 1 = kφ(n) + 1. By Theorem 5.12, y D = (xE )D = xDE = xkm+1 = (xφ(n) )k x = x mod n. We can now ask how one would go about breaking the RSA cryptosystem. To ﬁnd D given n and E, we simply need to factor n and solve for D by using the Euclidean algorithm. If we had known that 667 = 23 · 29 in Example 5, we could have recovered D.

Message Veriﬁcation
There is a problem of message veriﬁcation in public key cryptosystems. Since the encoding key is public knowledge, anyone has the ability to send an encoded message. If Alice receives a message from Bob, she would like to be able to verify that it was Bob who actually sent the message. Suppose that Bob’s encrypting key is (n , E ) and his decrypting key is (n , D ).

6.2

PUBLIC KEY CRYPTOGRAPHY

103

Also, suppose that Alice’s encrypting key is (n, E) and her decrypting key is (n, D). Since encryption keys are public information, they can exchange coded messages at their convenience. Bob wishes to assure Alice that the message he is sending is authentic. Before Bob sends the message x to Alice, he decrypts x with his own key: x = xD mod n . Anyone can change x back to x just by encryption, but only Bob has the ability to form x . Now Bob encrypts x with Alice’s encryption key to form y =x
E

mod n,

a message that only Alice can decode. Alice decodes the message and then encodes the result with Bob’s key to read the original message, a message that could have only been sent by Bob. Historical Note
Encrypting secret messages goes as far back as ancient Greece and Rome. As we know, Julius Caesar used a simple shift code to send and receive messages. However, the formal study of encoding and decoding messages probably began with the Arabs in the 1400s. In the ﬁfteenth and sixteenth centuries mathematicians such as Alberti and Viete discovered that monoalphabetic cryptosystems oﬀered no real security. In the 1800s, F. W. Kasiski established methods for breaking ciphers in which a ciphertext letter can represent more than one plaintext letter, if the same key was used several times. This discovery led to the use of cryptosystems with keys that were used only a single time. Cryptography was placed on ﬁrm mathematical foundations by such people as W. Friedman and L. Hill in the early part of the twentieth century. During World War II mathematicians were very active in cryptography. Eﬀorts to penetrate the cryptosystems of the Axis nations were organized in England and in the United States by such notable mathematicians as Alan Turing and A. A. Albert. The period after World War I saw the development of special-purpose machines for encrypting and decrypting messages. The Allies gained a tremendous advantage in World War II by breaking the ciphers produced by the German Enigma machine and the Japanese Purple ciphers. By the 1970s, interest in commercial cryptography had begun to take hold. There was a growing need to protect banking transactions, computer data, and electronic mail. In the early 1970s, IBM developed and implemented LUZIFER, the forerunner of the National Bureau of Standards’ Data Encryption Standard (DES). The concept of a public key cryptosystem, due to Diﬃe and Hellman, is very recent (1976). It was further developed by Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman with the

104

CHAPTER 6

INTRODUCTION TO CRYPTOGRAPHY

RSA cryptosystem (1978). It is not known how secure any of these systems are. The trapdoor knapsack cryptosystem, developed by Merkle and Hellman, has been broken. It is still an open question whether or not the RSA system can be broken. At the time of the writing of this book, the largest number factored is 135 digits long, and at the present moment a code is considered secure if the key is about 400 digits long and is the product of two 200-digit primes. There has been a great deal of controversy about research in cryptography in recent times: the National Security Agency would like to keep information about cryptography secret, whereas the academic community has fought for the right to publish basic research. Modern cryptography has come a long way since 1929, when Henry Stimson, Secretary of State under Herbert Hoover, dismissed the Black Chamber (the State Department’s cryptography division) in 1929 on the ethical grounds that “gentlemen do not read each other’s mail.”

Additional Exercises: Primality and Factoring
In the RSA cryptosystem it is important to be able to ﬁnd large prime numbers easily. Also, this cryptosystem is not secure if we can factor a composite number that is the product of two large primes. The solutions to both of these problems are quite easy. To ﬁnd out if a number n is prime or to factor n, we can use trial √ division. We simply divide n by d = 2, 3, . . . , n. Either a factorization will be obtained, or n is prime if no d divides n. The problem is that such a computation is prohibitively time-consuming if n is very large. 1. A better algorithm for factoring odd positive integers is Fermat’s factorization algorithm.

For example, 15 cannot be prime since 215−1 ≡ 214 ≡ 4 (mod 15). However, 17 is a potential prime since 217−1 ≡ 216 ≡ 1 (mod 17).

Compare the speed of the two programs. How many pseudoprimes are there below 2000? There exist composite numbers that are pseudoprimes for all bases to which they are relatively prime. These numbers are called Carmichael numbers. The ﬁrst Carmichael number is 561 = 3 · 11 · 17. In 1992, Alford, Granville, and Pomerance proved that there are an inﬁnite number of Carmichael numbers [4]. However, Carmichael numbers are very rare. There are only 2163 Carmichael numbers less than 25 × 109 . For more sophisticated primality tests, see [1], [6], or [7].

Algebraic Coding Theory

Coding theory is an application of algebra that has become increasingly important over the last several decades. When we transmit data, we are concerned about sending a message over a channel that could be aﬀected by “noise.” We wish to be able to encode and decode the information in a manner that will allow the detection, and possibly the correction, of errors caused by noise. This situation arises in many areas of communications, including radio, telephone, television, computer communications, and even compact disc player technology. Probability, combinatorics, group theory, linear algebra, and polynomial rings over ﬁnite ﬁelds all play important roles in coding theory.

7.1

Error-Detecting and Correcting Codes

Let us examine a simple model of a communications system for transmitting and receiving coded messages (Figure 7.1). Uncoded messages may be composed of letters or characters, but typically they consist of binary m-tuples. These messages are encoded into codewords, consisting of binary n-tuples, by a device called an encoder. The message is transmitted and then decoded. We will consider the occurrence of errors during transmission. An error occurs if there is a change in one or more bits in the codeword. A decoding scheme is a method that either converts an arbitrarily received n-tuple into a meaningful decoded message or gives an error message for that n-tuple. If the received message is a codeword (one of the special ntuples allowed to be transmitted), then the decoded message must be the unique message that was encoded into the codeword. For received noncodewords, the decoding scheme will give an error indication, or, if we are more clever, will actually try to correct the error and reconstruct the original mes108

Figure 7.1. Encoding and decoding messages sage. Our goal is to transmit error-free messages as cheaply and quickly as possible. Example 1. One possible coding scheme would be to send a message several times and to compare the received copies with one another. Suppose that the message to be encoded is a binary n-tuple (x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ). The message is encoded into a binary 3n-tuple by simply repeating the message three times: (x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ) → (x1 , x2 , . . . , xn , x1 , x2 , . . . , xn , x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ). To decode the message, we choose as the ith digit the one that appears in the ith place in at least two of the three transmissions. For example, if the original message is (0110), then the transmitted message will be (0110 0110 0110). If there is a transmission error in the ﬁfth digit, then the received codeword will be (0110 1110 0110), which will be correctly decoded as (0110).1 This

We will adopt the convention that bits are numbered left to right in binary n-tuples.

CHAPTER 7

ALGEBRAIC CODING THEORY

triple-repetition method will automatically detect and correct all single errors, but it is slow and ineﬃcient: to send a message consisting of n bits, 2n extra bits are required, and we can only detect and correct single errors. We will see that it is possible to ﬁnd an encoding scheme that will encode a message of n bits into m bits with m much smaller than 3n. Example 2. Even parity, a commonly used coding scheme, is much more eﬃcient than the simple repetition scheme. The ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) coding system uses binary 8-tuples, yielding 28 = 256 possible 8-tuples. However, only seven bits are needed since there are only 27 = 128 ASCII characters. What can or should be done with the extra bit? Using the full eight bits, we can detect single transmission errors. For example, the ASCII codes for A, B, and C are A = 6510 = 010000012 , B = 6610 = 010000102 , C = 6710 = 010000112 . Notice that the leftmost bit is always set to 0; that is, the 128 ASCII characters have codes 000000002 = 010 , . . . 011111112 = 12710 . The bit can be used for error checking on the other seven bits. It is set to either 0 or 1 so that the total number of 1 bits in the representation of a character is even. Using even parity, the codes for A, B, and C now become A = 010000012 , B = 010000102 , C = 110000112 . Suppose an A is sent and a transmission error in the sixth bit is caused by noise over the communication channel so that (01000101) is received. We know an error has occurred since the received word has an odd number of 1’s, and we can now request that the codeword be transmitted again. When used for error checking, the leftmost bit is called a parity check bit. By far the most common error-detecting codes used in computers are based on the addition of a parity bit. Typically, a computer stores information in m-tuples called words. Common word lengths are 8, 16, and 32 bits.

7.1

ERROR-DETECTING AND CORRECTING CODES

111

One bit in the word is set aside as the parity check bit, and is not used to store information. This bit is set to either 0 or 1, depending on the number of 1’s in the word. Adding a parity check bit allows the detection of all single errors because changing a single bit either increases or decreases the number of 1’s by one, and in either case the parity has been changed from even to odd, so the new word is not a codeword. (We could also construct an error detection scheme based on odd parity; that is, we could set the parity check bit so that a codeword always has an odd number of 1’s.) The even parity system is easy to implement, but has two drawbacks. First, multiple errors are not detectable. Suppose an A is sent and the ﬁrst and seventh bits are changed from 0 to 1. The received word is a codeword, but will be decoded into a C instead of an A. Second, we do not have the ability to correct errors. If the 8-tuple (10011000) is received, we know that an error has occurred, but we have no idea which bit has been changed. We will now investigate a coding scheme that will not only allow us to detect transmission errors but will actually correct the errors.

Table 7.1. A repetition code
Transmitted Codeword 000 111 000 0 3 001 1 2 010 1 2 Received Word 011 100 101 2 1 2 1 2 1 110 2 1 111 3 0

Example 3. Suppose that our original message is either a 0 or a 1, and that 0 encodes to (000) and 1 encodes to (111). If only a single error occurs during transmission, we can detect and correct the error. For example, if a 101 is received, then the second bit must have been changed from a 1 to a 0. The originally transmitted codeword must have been (111). This method will detect and correct all single errors. In Table 7.1, we present all possible words that might be received for the transmitted codewords (000) and (111). Table 7.1 also shows the number of bits by which each received 3-tuple diﬀers from each original codeword.

112

CHAPTER 7

ALGEBRAIC CODING THEORY

Maximum-Likelihood Decoding2
The coding scheme presented in Example 3 is not a complete solution to the problem because it does not account for the possibility of multiple errors. For example, either a (000) or a (111) could be sent and a (001) received. We have no means of deciding from the received word whether there was a single error in the third bit or two errors, one in the ﬁrst bit and one in the second. No matter what coding scheme is used, an incorrect message could be received: we could transmit a (000), have errors in all three bits, and receive the codeword (111). It is important to make explicit assumptions about the likelihood and distribution of transmission errors so that, in a particular application, it will be known whether a given error detection scheme is appropriate. We will assume that transmission errors are rare, and, that when they do occur, they occur independently in each bit; that is, if p is the probability of an error in one bit and q is the probability of an error in a diﬀerent bit, then the probability of errors occurring in both of these bits at the same time is pq. We will also assume that a received n-tuple is decoded into a codeword that is closest to it; that is, we assume that the receiver uses maximum-likelihood decoding.

Figure 7.2. Binary symmetric channel A binary symmetric channel is a model that consists of a transmitter capable of sending a binary signal, either a 0 or a 1, together with a receiver. Let p be the probability that the signal is correctly received. Then q = 1 − p is the probability of an incorrect reception. If a 1 is sent, then the probability that a 1 is received is p and the probability that a 0 is received is q (Figure 7.2). The probability that no errors occur during the transmission of a binary codeword of length n is pn . For example, if p = 0.999 and a message consisting of 10,000 bits is sent, then the probability of a perfect transmission is (0.999)10,000 ≈ 0.00005.

Theorem 7.1 If a binary n-tuple (x1 , . . . , xn ) is transmitted across a binary symmetric channel with probability p that no error will occur in each coordinate, then the probability that there are errors in exactly k coordinates is n k q k pn−k .

Proof. Fix k diﬀerent coordinates. We ﬁrst compute the probability that an error has occurred in this ﬁxed set of coordinates. The probability of an error occurring in a particular one of these k coordinates is q; the probability that an error will not occur in any of the remaining n − k coordinates is p. The probability of each of these n independent events is q k pn−k . The number of possible error patterns with exactly k errors occurring is equal to n k = n! , k!(n − k)!

the number of combinations of n things taken k at a time. Each of these error patterns has probability q k pn−k of occurring; hence, the probability of all of these error patterns is n k q k pn−k .

Example 4. Suppose that p = 0.995 and a 500-bit message is sent. The probability that the message was sent error-free is pn = (0.995)500 ≈ 0.082. The probability of exactly one error occurring is n 1 qpn−1 = 500(0.005)(0.995)499 ≈ 0.204.

The probability of exactly two errors is n 2 q 2 pn−2 = 500 · 499 (0.005)2 (0.995)498 ≈ 0.257. 2

The probability of more than two errors is approximately 1 − 0.082 − 0.204 − 0.257 = 0.457.

CHAPTER 7

ALGEBRAIC CODING THEORY

Block Codes
If we are to develop eﬃcient error-detecting and error-correcting codes, we will need more sophisticated mathematical tools. Group theory will allow faster methods of encoding and decoding messages. A code is an (n, m)block code if the information that is to be coded can be divided into blocks of m binary digits, each of which can be encoded into n binary digits. More speciﬁcally, an (n, m)-block code consists of an encoding function E : Zm → Zn 2 2 and a decoding function D : Zn → Zm . 2 2 A codeword is any element in the image of E. We also require that E be one-to-one so that two information blocks will not be encoded into the same codeword. If our code is to be error-correcting, then D must be onto. Example 5. The even-parity coding system developed to detect single errors in ASCII characters is an (8, 7)-block code. The encoding function is E(x7 , x6 , . . . , x1 ) = (x8 , x7 , . . . , x1 ), where x8 = x7 + x6 + · · · + x1 with addition in Z2 . Let x = (x1 , . . . , xn ) and y = (y1 , . . . , yn ) be binary n-tuples. The Hamming distance or distance, d(x, y), between x and y is the number of bits in which x and y diﬀer. The distance between two codewords is the minimum number of transmission errors required to change one codeword into the other. The minimum distance for a code, dmin , is the minimum of all distances d(x, y), where x and y are distinct codewords. The weight, w(x), of a binary codeword x is the number of 1’s in x. Clearly, w(x) = d(x, 0), where 0 = (00 · · · 0). Example 6. Let x = (10101), y = (11010), and z = (00011) be all of the codewords in some code C. Then we have the following Hamming distances: d(x, y) = 4, d(x, z) = 3, d(y, z) = 3.

7.1

ERROR-DETECTING AND CORRECTING CODES

115

The minimum distance for this code is 3. We also have the following weights: w(x) = 3, w(y) = 3, w(z) = 2.

The following proposition lists some basic properties about the weight of a codeword and the distance between two codewords. The proof is left as an exercise. Proposition 7.2 Let x, y, and z be binary n-tuples. Then 1. w(x) = d(x, 0); 2. d(x, y) ≥ 0; 3. d(x, y) = 0 exactly when x = y; 4. d(x, y) = d(y, x); 5. d(x, y) ≤ d(x, z) + d(z, y). The weights in a particular code are usually much easier to compute than the Hamming distances between all codewords in the code. If a code is set up carefully, we can use this fact to our advantage. Suppose that x = (1101) and y = (1100) are codewords in some code. If we transmit (1101) and an error occurs in the rightmost bit, then (1100) will be received. Since (1100) is a codeword, the decoder will decode (1100) as the transmitted message. This code is clearly not very appropriate for error detection. The problem is that d(x, y) = 1. If x = (1100) and y = (1010) are codewords, then d(x, y) = 2. If x is transmitted and a single error occurs, then y can never be received. Table 7.2 gives the distances between all 4-bit codewords in which the ﬁrst three bits carry information and the fourth is an even parity check bit. We can see that the minimum distance here is 2; hence, the code is suitable as a single error-correcting code. To determine exactly what the error-detecting and error-correcting capabilities for a code are, we need to analyze the minimum distance for the code. Let x and y be codewords. If d(x, y) = 1 and an error occurs where x and y diﬀer, then x is changed to y. The received codeword is y and no error message is given. Now suppose d(x, y) = 2. Then a single error cannot

change x to y. Therefore, if dmin = 2, we have the ability to detect single errors. However, suppose that d(x, y) = 2, y is sent, and a noncodeword z is received such that d(x, z) = d(y, z) = 1. Then the decoder cannot decide between x and y. Even though we are aware that an error has occurred, we do not know what the error is. Suppose dmin ≥ 3. Then the maximum-likelihood decoding scheme corrects all single errors. Starting with a codeword x, an error in the transmission of a single bit gives y with d(x, y) = 1, but d(z, y) ≥ 2 for any other codeword z = x. If we do not require the correction of errors, then we can detect multiple errors when a code has a minimum distance that is greater than 3. Theorem 7.3 Let C be a code with dmin = 2n + 1. Then C can correct any n or fewer errors. Furthermore, any 2n or fewer errors can be detected in C. Proof. Suppose that a codeword x is sent and the word y is received with at most n errors. Then d(x, y) ≤ n. If z is any codeword other than x, then 2n + 1 ≤ d(x, z) ≤ d(x, y) + d(y, z) ≤ n + d(y, z). Hence, d(y, z) ≥ n + 1 and y will be correctly decoded as x. Now suppose that x is transmitted and y is received and that at least one error has occurred, but not more than 2n errors. Then 1 ≤ d(x, y) ≤ 2n. Since the minimum distance between codewords is 2n + 1, y cannot be a codeword. Consequently, the code can detect between 1 and 2n errors.

Historical Note
Modern coding theory began in 1948 with C. Shannon’s paper, “A Mathematical Theory of Information” [7]. This paper oﬀered an example of an algebraic code, and Shannon’s Theorem proclaimed exactly how good codes could be expected to be. Richard Hamming began working with linear codes at Bell Labs in the late 1940s and early 1950s after becoming frustrated because the programs that he was running could not recover from simple errors generated by noise. Coding theory has grown tremendously in the past several years. The Theory of Error-Correcting Codes, by MacWilliams and Sloane [5], published in 1977, already contained over 1500 references. Linear codes (Reed-Muller (32, 6)-block codes) were used on NASA’s Mariner space probes. More recent space probes such as Voyager have used what are called convolution codes. Currently, very active research is being done with Goppa codes, which are heavily dependent on algebraic geometry.

7.2

Linear Codes

To gain more knowledge of a particular code and develop more eﬃcient techniques of encoding, decoding, and error detection, we need to add additional structure to our codes. One way to accomplish this is to require that the code also be a group. A group code is a code that is also a subgroup of Zn . 2 To check that a code is a group code, we need only verify one thing. If we add any two elements in the code, the result must be an n-tuple that is again in the code. It is not necessary to check that the inverse of the n-tuple is in the code, since every codeword is its own inverse, nor is it necessary to

118

CHAPTER 7

ALGEBRAIC CODING THEORY

check that 0 is a codeword. For instance, (11000101) + (11000101) = (00000000). Example 8. Suppose that we have 7-tuples: (0000000) (0001111) (0100110) (0101001) (1000011) (1001100) (1100101) (1101010) a code that consists of the following (0010101) (0011010) (0110011) (0111100) (1010110) (1011001) (1110000) (1111111).

It is a straightforward though tedious task to verify that this code is also a subgroup of Z7 and, therefore, a group code. This code is a single error2 detecting and single error-correcting code, but it is a long and tedious process to compute all of the distances between pairs of codewords to determine that dmin = 3. It is much easier to see that the minimum weight of all the nonzero codewords is 3. As we will soon see, this is no coincidence. However, the relationship between weights and distances in a particular code is heavily dependent on the fact that the code is a group. Lemma 7.4 Let x and y be binary n-tuples. Then w(x + y) = d(x, y). Proof. Suppose that x and y are binary n-tuples. Then the distance between x and y is exactly the number of places in which x and y diﬀer. But x and y diﬀer in a particular coordinate exactly when the sum in the coordinate is 1, since 1+1 = 0 0+0 = 0 1+0 = 1 0 + 1 = 1. Consequently, the weight of the sum must be the distance between the two codewords. Theorem 7.5 Let dmin be the minimum distance for a group code C. Then dmin is the minimum of all the nonzero weights of the nonzero codewords in C. That is, dmin = min{w(x) : x = 0}.

7.2

LINEAR CODES

119

Proof. Observe that dmin = min{d(x, y) : x = y} = min{d(x, y) : x + y = 0} = min{w(x + y) : x + y = 0} = min{w(z) : z = 0}.

Linear Codes
From Example 8, it is now easy to check that the minimum nonzero weight is 3; hence, the code does indeed detect and correct all single errors. We have now reduced the problem of ﬁnding “good” codes to that of generating group codes. One easy way to generate group codes is to employ a bit of matrix theory. Deﬁne the inner product of two binary n-tuples to be x · y = x1 y1 + · · · + xn yn , where x = (x1 , x2 , . . . , xn )t and y = (y1 , y2 , . . . , yn )t are column vectors.3 For example, if x = (011001)t and y = (110101)t , then x · y = 0. We can also look at an inner product as the product of a row matrix with a column matrix; that is, x · y = xt y  = x1 x2 · · · xn     y1 y2 . . .     

yn = x1 y1 + x2 y2 + · · · + xn yn . Example 9. Suppose that the words to be encoded consist of all binary 3-tuples and that our encoding scheme is even-parity. To encode an arbitrary 3-tuple, we add a fourth bit to obtain an even number of 1’s. Notice that an arbitrary n-tuple x = (x1 , x2 , . . . , xn )t has an even number of 1’s exactly

when x1 + x2 + · · · + xn = 0; hence, a 4-tuple x = (x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 )t has an even number of 1’s if x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 = 0, or   1  1  x · 1 = xt 1 = x1 x2 x3 x4   = 0.  1  1 This example leads us to hope that there is a connection between matrices and coding theory. Let Mm×n (Z2 ) denote the set of all m×n matrices with entries in Z2 . We do matrix operations as usual except that all our addition and multiplication operations occur in Z2 . Deﬁne the null space of a matrix H ∈ Mm×n (Z2 ) to be the set of all binary n-tuples x such that Hx = 0. We denote the null space of a matrix H by Null(H). Example 10. Suppose that  0 1 0 1 0 H =  1 1 1 1 0 . 0 0 1 1 1  For a 5-tuple x = (x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 , x5 )t to be in the null space of H, Hx = 0. Equivalently, the following system of equations must be satisﬁed: x2 + x4 = 0 x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 = 0 x3 + x4 + x5 = 0. The set of binary 5-tuples satisfying these equations is (00000) (11110) (10101) (01011). This code is easily determined to be a group code. Theorem 7.6 Let H be in Mm×n (Z2 ). Then the null space of H is a group code. Proof. Since each element of Zn is its own inverse, the only thing that 2 really needs to be checked here is closure. Let x, y ∈ Null(H) for some matrix H in Mm×n (Z2 ). Then Hx = 0 and Hy = 0. So H(x + y) = H(x + y) = Hx + Hy = 0 + 0 = 0.

Hence, x + y is in the null space of H and therefore must be a codeword.

A code is a linear code if it is determined by the null space of some matrix H ∈ Mm×n (Z2 ). Example 11. Let C be the code given by the matrix  0 0 0 1 1 1 H =  0 1 1 0 1 1 . 1 0 1 0 0 1 Suppose that the 7-tuple x = (010011)t is received. It is a simple matter of matrix multiplication to determine whether or not x is a codeword. Since  0 Hx =  1  , 1 the received word is not a codeword. We must either attempt to correct the word or request that it be transmitted again.  

Parity-Check and Generator Matrices

We need to ﬁnd a systematic way of generating linear codes as well as fast methods of decoding. By examining the properties of a matrix H and by carefully choosing H, it is possible to develop very eﬃcient methods of encoding and decoding messages. To this end, we will introduce standard generator and canonical parity-check matrices. Suppose that H is an m × n matrix with entries in Z2 and n > m. If the last m columns of the matrix form the m × m identity matrix, Im , then the matrix is a canonical parity-check matrix. More speciﬁcally, H = (A | Im ), where A is the m × (n − m) matrix      a11 a21 . . . a12 a22 . . . ··· ··· .. . a1,n−m a2,n−m . . . am,n−m     

   . 

With each canonical parity-check matrix we can associate an n × (n − m) standard generator matrix G= In−m A .

Our goal will be to show that Gx = y if and only if Hy = 0. Given a message block x to be encoded, G will allow us to quickly encode it into a linear codeword y. Example 12. Suppose that we have the following eight words to be encoded: (000), (001), (010), . . . , (111). For  0 1 1 A =  1 1 0 , 1 0 1 the associated standard generator and canonical parity-check matrices are     G=    and  0 1 1 1 0 0 H =  1 1 0 0 1 0 , 1 0 1 0 0 1 respectively. Observe that the rows in H represent the parity checks on certain bit positions in a 6-tuple. The 1’s in the identity matrix serve as parity checks  1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1         

for the 1’s in the same row. If x = (x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 , x5 , x6 ), then   x2 + x3 + x4 0 = Hx =  x1 + x2 + x5  , x1 + x3 + x6 which yields a system of equations: x2 + x3 + x4 = 0 x1 + x2 + x5 = 0 x1 + x3 + x6 = 0. Here x4 serves as a check bit for x2 and x3 ; x5 is a check bit for x1 and x2 ; and x6 is a check bit for x1 and x3 . The identity matrix keeps x4 , x5 , and x6 from having to check on each other. Hence, x1 , x2 , and x3 can be arbitrary but x4 , x5 , and x6 must be chosen to ensure parity. The null space of H is easily computed to be (000000) (001101) (010110) (011011) (100011) (101110) (110101) (111000). An even easier way to compute the null space is with the generator matrix G (Table 7.4). Table 7.4. A matrix-generated code

Theorem 7.7 Let H ∈ Mm×n (Z2 ) be a canonical parity-check matrix. Then Null(H) consists of all x ∈ Zn whose ﬁrst n − m bits are arbitrary but whose 2 last m bits are determined by Hx = 0. Each of the last m bits serves as an even parity check bit for some of the ﬁrst n − m bits. Hence, H gives rise to an (n, n − m)-block code.

124

CHAPTER 7

ALGEBRAIC CODING THEORY

We leave the proof of this theorem as an exercise. In light of the theorem, the ﬁrst n−m bits in x are called information bits and the last m bits are called check bits. In Example 12, the ﬁrst three bits are the information bits and the last three are the check bits. Theorem 7.8 Suppose that G is an n × k standard generator matrix. Then C = {y : Gx = y for x ∈ Zk } is an (n, k)-block code. More speciﬁcally, C is 2 a group code. Proof. Let Gx1 = y1 and Gx2 = y2 be two codewords. Then y1 + y2 is in C since G(x1 + x2 ) = Gx1 + Gx2 = y1 + y2 . We must also show that two message blocks cannot be encoded into the same codeword. That is, we must show that if Gx = Gy, then x = y. Suppose that Gx = Gy. Then Gx − Gy = G(x − y) = 0. However, the ﬁrst k coordinates in G(x − y) are exactly x1 − y1 , . . . , xk − yk , since they are determined by the identity matrix, Ik , part of G. Hence, G(x − y) = 0 exactly when x = y. Before we can prove the relationship between canonical parity-check matrices and standard generating matrices, we need to prove a lemma. Lemma 7.9 Let H = (A | Im ) be an m × n canonical parity-check matrix and G = In−m be the corresponding n×(n−m) standard generator matrix. A Then HG = 0. Proof. Let C = HG. The ijth entry in C is

where δij = is the Kronecker delta. Theorem 7.10 Let H = (A | Im ) be an m×n canonical parity-check matrix and let G = In−m be the n × (n − m) standard generator matrix associated A with H. Let C be the code generated by G. Then y is in C if and only if Hy = 0. In particular, C is a linear code with canonical parity-check matrix H. Proof. First suppose that y ∈ C. Then Gx = y for some x ∈ Zm . By 2 Lemma 7.9, Hy = HGx = 0. Conversely, suppose that y = (y1 , . . . , yn )t is in the null space of H. We need to ﬁnd an x in Zn−m such that Gxt = y. Since Hy = 0, the following 2 set of equations must be satisﬁed: a11 y1 + a12 y2 + · · · + a1,n−m yn−m + yn−m+1 = 0 a21 y1 + a22 y2 + · · · + a2,n−m yn−m + yn−m+1 = 0 . . . am1 y1 + am2 y2 + · · · + am,n−m yn−m + yn−m+1 = 0. Equivalently, yn−m+1 , . . . , yn are determined by y1 , . . . , yn−m : yn−m+1 = a11 y1 + a12 y2 + · · · + a1,n−m yn−m yn−m+1 = a21 y1 + a22 y2 + · · · + a2,n−m yn−m . . . yn−m+1 = am1 y1 + am2 y2 + · · · + am,n−m yn−m . Consequently, we can let xi = yi for i = 1, . . . , n − m. It would be helpful if we could compute the minimum distance of a linear code directly from its matrix H in order to determine the error-detecting and error-correcting capabilities of the code. Suppose that e1 = (100 · · · 00)t e2 = (010 · · · 00)t . . . en = (000 · · · 01)t 1 i=j 0 i=j

are the n-tuples in Zn of weight 1. For an m × n binary matrix H, Hei is 2 exactly the ith column of the matrix H. Example 13. Observe that   1 1 1 0 0    1 0 0 1 0   1 1 0 0 1   0 1 0 0 0     1   =  0 .   1

We state this result in the following proposition and leave the proof as an exercise. Proposition 7.11 Let ei be the binary n-tuple with a 1 in the ith coordinate and 0’s elsewhere and suppose that H ∈ Mm×n (Z2 ). Then Hei is the ith column of the matrix H. Theorem 7.12 Let H be an m × n binary matrix. Then the null space of H is a single error-detecting code if and only if no column of H consists entirely of zeros. Proof. Suppose that Null(H) is a single error-detecting code. Then the minimum distance of the code must be at least 2. Since the null space is a group code, it is suﬃcient to require that the code contain no codewords of less than weight 2 other than the zero codeword. That is, ei must not be a codeword for i = 1, . . . , n. Since Hei is the ith column of H, the only way in which ei could be in the null space of H would be if the ith column were all zeros, which is impossible; hence, the code must have the capability to detect at least single errors. Conversely, suppose that no column of H is the zero column. By Proposition 7.11, Hei = 0. Example 14. If we consider the matrices   1 1 1 0 0 H1 =  1 0 0 1 0  1 1 0 0 1 and  1 1 1 0 0 H2 =  1 0 0 0 0  , 1 1 0 0 1 

7.3

127

then the null space of H1 is a single error-detecting code and the null space of H2 is not. We can even do better than Theorem 7.12. This theorem gives us conditions on a matrix H that tell us when the minimum weight of the code formed by the null space of H is 2. We can also determine when the minimum distance of a linear code is 3 by examining the corresponding matrix. Example 15. If we let  1 1 1 0 H= 1 0 0 1  1 1 0 0 and want to determine whether or not H is the canonical parity-check matrix for an error-correcting code, it is necessary to make certain that Null(H) does not contain any 4-tuples of weight 2. That is, (1100), (1010), (1001), (0110), (0101), and (0011) must not be in Null(H). The next theorem states that we can indeed determine that the code generated by H is errorcorrecting by examining the columns of H. Notice in this example that not only does H have no zero columns, but also that no two columns are the same. Theorem 7.13 Let H be a binary matrix. The null space of H is a single error-correcting code if and only if H does not contain any zero columns and no two columns of H are identical. Proof. The n-tuple ei + ej has 1’s in the ith and jth entries and 0’s elsewhere, and w(ei + ej ) = 2 for i = j. Since 0 = H(ei + ej ) = Hei + Hej can only occur if the ith and jth columns are identical, the null space of H is a single error-correcting code. Suppose now that we have a canonical parity-check matrix H with three rows. Then we might ask how many more columns we can add to the matrix and still have a null space that is a single error-detecting and single error-correcting code. Since each column has three entries, there are 23 = 8 possible distinct columns. We cannot add the columns         0 1 0 0  0 , 0 , 1 , 0 . 0 0 0 1 

128

CHAPTER 7

ALGEBRAIC CODING THEORY

So we can add as many as four columns and still maintain a minimum distance of 3. In general, if H is an m × n canonical parity-check matrix, then there are n − m information positions in each codeword. Each column has m bits, so there are 2m possible distinct columns. It is necessary that the columns 0, e1 , . . . , en be excluded, leaving 2m − (1 + n) remaining columns for information if we are still to maintain the ability not only to detect but also to correct single errors.

7.4

Eﬃcient Decoding

We are now at the stage where we are able to generate linear codes that detect and correct errors fairly easily, but it is still a time-consuming process to decode a received n-tuple and determine which is the closest codeword, because the received n-tuple must be compared to each possible codeword to determine the proper decoding. This can be a serious impediment if the code is very large. Example 16. Given the binary matrix   1 1 1 0 0 H= 0 1 0 1 0  1 0 0 0 1 and the 5-tuples x = (11011)t and y = (01011)t , we can compute   0 Hx =  0  0 and  1 Hy =  0  . 1 

Hence, x is a codeword and y is not, since x is in the null space and y is not. Notice that Hx is identical to the ﬁrst column of H. In fact, this is where the error occurred. If we ﬂip the ﬁrst bit in y from 0 to 1, then we obtain x. If H is an m × n matrix and x ∈ Zn , then we say that the syndrome of 2 x is Hx. The following proposition allows the quick detection and correction of errors.

7.4

EFFICIENT DECODING

129

Proposition 7.14 Let the m × n binary matrix H determine a linear code and let x be the received n-tuple. Write x as x = c + e, where c is the transmitted codeword and e is the transmission error. Then the syndrome Hx of the received codeword x is also the syndrome of the error e. Proof. Hx = H(c + e) = Hc + He = 0 + He = He. This proposition tells us that the syndrome of a received word depends solely on the error and not on the transmitted codeword. The proof of the following theorem follows immediately from Proposition 7.14 and from the fact that He is the ith column of the matrix H. Theorem 7.15 Let H ∈ Mm×n (Z2 ) and suppose that the linear code corresponding to H is single error-correcting. Let r be a received n-tuple that was transmitted with at most one error. If the syndrome of r is 0, then no error has occurred; otherwise, if the syndrome of r is equal to some column of H, say the ith column, then the error has occurred in the ith bit. Example 17. Consider the matrix   1 0 1 1 0 0 H= 0 1 1 0 1 0  1 1 1 0 0 1 and suppose that the 6-tuples x = (111110)t , y = (010111)t have been received. Then      1 1 Hx =  1  , Hy =  1  , Hz =  1 0 (111111)t , and z =  1 0 . 0

Hence, x has an error in the third bit and z has an error in the fourth bit. The transmitted codewords for x and z must have been (110110) and (010011), respectively. The syndrome of y does not occur in any of the columns of the matrix H, so multiple errors must have occurred to produce y.

Coset Decoding
We can use group theory to obtain another way of decoding messages. A linear code C is a subgroup of Zn . Coset or standard decoding uses the 2 cosets of C in Zn to implement maximum-likelihood decoding. Suppose that 2 C is an (n, m)-linear code. A coset of C in Zn is written in the form x + C, 2

where x ∈ Zn . By Lagrange’s Theorem, there are 2n−m distinct cosets of C 2 in Zn . 2 Example 18. Let C be the (5, 3)-linear code given by the parity-check matrix   0 1 1 0 0 H =  1 0 0 1 0 . 1 1 0 0 1 The code consists of the codewords (00000) (01101) (10011) (11110). There are 25−2 = 23 cosets of C in Z5 , each with order 22 = 4. These cosets 2 are listed in Table 7.5. Our task is to ﬁnd out how knowing the cosets might help us to decode a message. Suppose that x was the original codeword sent and that r is the n-tuple received. If e is the transmission error, then r = e + x or, equivalently, x = e + r. However, this is exactly the statement that r is an element in the coset e + C. In maximum-likelihood decoding we expect the error e to be as small as possible; that is, e will have the least weight. An n-tuple of least weight in a coset is called a coset leader. Once we have determined a coset leader for each coset, the decoding process becomes a task of calculating r + e to obtain x. Example 19. In Table 7.5, notice that we have chosen a representative of the least possible weight for each coset. These representatives are coset leaders. Now suppose that r = (01111) is the received word. To decode r, we ﬁnd that it is in the coset (00010) + C; hence, the originally transmitted codeword must have been (01101) = (01111) + (00010).

EXERCISES

131

A potential problem with this method of decoding is that we might have to examine every coset for the received codeword. The following proposition gives a method of implementing coset decoding. It states that we can associate a syndrome with each coset; hence, we can make a table that designates a coset leader corresponding to each syndrome. Such a list is called a decoding table. Proposition 7.16 Let C be an (n, k)-linear code given by the matrix H and suppose that x and y are in Zn . Then x and y are in the same coset of C 2 if and only if Hx = Hy. That is, two n-tuples are in the same coset if and only if their syndromes are the same. Proof. Two n-tuples x and y are in the same coset of C exactly when x − y ∈ C; however, this is equivalent to H(x − y) = 0 or Hx = Hy. Example 20. Table 7.6 is a decoding table for the code C given in Example 18. If x = (01111) is received, then its syndrome can be computed to be   0 Hx =  1  . 1 Examining the decoding table, we determine that the coset leader is (00010). It is now easy to decode the received codeword. Given an (n, k)-block code, the question arises of whether or not coset decoding is a manageable scheme. A decoding table requires a list of cosets and syndromes, one for each of the 2n−k cosets of C. Suppose that we have a (32, 24)-block code. We have a huge number of codewords, 224 , yet there are only 232−24 = 28 = 256 cosets. Table 7.6. Syndromes for each coset

Isomorphisms

Many groups may appear to be diﬀerent at ﬁrst glance, but can be shown to be the same by a simple renaming of the group elements. For example, Z4 and the subgroup of the circle group T generated by i can be shown to be the same by demonstrating a one-to-one correspondence between the elements of the two groups and between the group operations. In such a case we say that the groups are isomorphic.

8.1

Deﬁnition and Examples

Two groups (G, ·) and (H, ◦) are isomorphic if there exists a one-to-one and onto map φ : G → H such that the group operation is preserved; that is, φ(a · b) = φ(a) ◦ φ(b) for all a and b in G. If G is isomorphic to H, we write G ∼ H. The map φ = is called an isomorphism. Example 1. To show that Z4 ∼ i , deﬁne a map φ : Z4 → i by φ(n) = in . = We must show that φ is bijective and preserves the group operation. The map φ is one-to-one and onto because φ(0) = 1 φ(1) = i φ(2) = −1 φ(3) = −i. Since φ(m + n) = im+n = im in = φ(m)φ(n), 138

8.1

DEFINITION AND EXAMPLES

the group operation is preserved. Example 2. We can deﬁne an isomorphism φ from the additive group of real numbers (R, +) to the multiplicative group of positive real numbers (R+ , ·) with the exponential map; that is, φ(x + y) = ex+y = ex ey = φ(x)φ(y). Of course, we must still show that φ is one-to-one and onto, but this can be determined using calculus. Example 3. The integers are isomorphic to the subgroup of Q∗ consisting of elements of the form 2n . Deﬁne a map φ : Z → Q∗ by φ(n) = 2n . Then φ(m + n) = 2m+n = 2m 2n = φ(m)φ(n). By deﬁnition the map φ is onto the subset {2n : n ∈ Z} of Q∗ . To show that the map is injective, assume that m = n. If we can show that φ(m) = φ(n), then we are done. Suppose that m > n and assume that φ(m) = φ(n). Then 2m = 2n or 2m−n = 1, which is impossible since m − n > 0. Example 4. The groups Z8 and Z12 cannot be isomorphic since they have diﬀerent orders; however, it is true that U (8) ∼ U (12). We know that = U (8) = {1, 3, 5, 7} U (12) = {1, 5, 7, 11}. An isomorphism φ : U (8) → U (12) is then given by 1 → 1 3 → 5 5 → 7 7 → 11. The map φ is not the only possible isomorphism between these two groups. We could deﬁne another isomorphism ψ by ψ(1) = 1, ψ(3) = 11, ψ(5) = 5, ψ(7) = 7. In fact, both of these groups are isomorphic to Z2 × Z2 (see Example 14 in Chapter 2). Example 5. Even though S3 and Z6 possess the same number of elements, we would suspect that they are not isomorphic, because Z6 is abelian and S3 is nonabelian. To demonstrate that this is indeed the case, suppose that φ : Z6 → S3 is an isomorphism. Let a, b ∈ S3 be two elements such that

140

CHAPTER 8

ISOMORPHISMS

ab = ba. Since φ is an isomorphism, there exist elements m and n in Z6 such that φ(m) = a φ(n) = b. However, ab = φ(m)φ(n) = φ(m + n) = φ(n + m) = φ(n)φ(m) = ba, which contradicts the fact that a and b do not commute. Theorem 8.1 Let φ : G → H be an isomorphism of two groups. Then the following statements are true. 1. φ−1 : H → G is an isomorphism. 2. |G| = |H|. 3. If G is abelian, then H is abelian. 4. If G is cyclic, then H is cyclic. 5. If G has a subgroup of order n, then H has a subgroup of order n. Proof. Assertions (1) and (2) follow from the fact that φ is a bijection. We will prove (3) here and leave the remainder of the theorem to be proved in the exercises. (3) Suppose that h1 and h2 are elements of H. Since φ is onto, there exist elements g1 , g2 ∈ G such that φ(g1 ) = h1 and φ(g2 ) = h2 . Therefore, h1 h2 = φ(g1 )φ(g2 ) = φ(g1 g2 ) = φ(g2 g1 ) = φ(g2 )φ(g1 ) = h2 h1 .

We are now in a position to characterize all cyclic groups. Theorem 8.2 All cyclic groups of inﬁnite order are isomorphic to Z. Proof. Let G be a cyclic group with inﬁnite order and suppose that a is a generator of G. Deﬁne a map φ : Z → G by φ : n → an . Then φ(m + n) = am+n = am an = φ(m)φ(n).

8.1

DEFINITION AND EXAMPLES

141

To show that φ is injective, suppose that m and n are two elements in Z, where m = n. We can assume that m > n. We must show that am = an . Let us suppose the contrary; that is, am = an . In this case am−n = e, where m − n > 0, which contradicts the fact that a has inﬁnite order. Our map is onto since any element in G can be written as an for some integer n and φ(n) = an . Theorem 8.3 If G is a cyclic group of order n, then G is isomorphic to Zn . Proof. Let G be a cyclic group of order n generated by a and deﬁne a map φ : Zn → G by φ : k → ak , where 0 ≤ k < n. The proof that φ is an isomorphism is one of the end-of-chapter exercises. Corollary 8.4 If G is a group of order p, where p is a prime number, then G is isomorphic to Zp . Proof. The proof is a direct result of Corollary 5.7. The main goal in group theory is to classify all groups; however, it makes sense to consider two groups to be the same if they are isomorphic. We state this result in the following theorem, whose proof is left as an exercise. Theorem 8.5 The isomorphism of groups determines an equivalence relation on the class of all groups. Hence, we can modify our goal of classifying all groups to classifying all groups up to isomorphism; that is, we will consider two groups to be the same if they are isomorphic.

Cayley’s Theorem
Cayley proved that if G is a group, it is isomorphic to a group of permutations on some set; hence, every group is a permutation group. Cayley’s Theorem is what we call a representation theorem. The aim of representation theory is to ﬁnd an isomorphism of some group G that we wish to study into a group that we know a great deal about, such as a group of permutations or matrices. Example 6. Consider the group Z3 . The Cayley table for Z3 is as follows. + 0 1 2 0 0 1 2 1 1 2 0 2 2 0 1

142

CHAPTER 8

ISOMORPHISMS

The addition table of Z3 suggests that it is the same as the permutation group G = {(0), (012), (021)}. The isomorphism here is 0→ 1→ 2→ 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2 1 2 0 0 1 2 2 0 1 = (0) = (012) = (021).

Theorem 8.6 (Cayley) Every group is isomorphic to a group of permutations. Proof. Let G be a group. We must ﬁnd a group of permutations G that is isomorphic to G. For any g ∈ G, deﬁne a function λg : G → G by λg (a) = ga. We claim that λg is a permutation of G. To show that λg is one-to-one, suppose that λg (a) = λg (b). Then ga = λg (a) = λg (b) = gb. Hence, a = b. To show that λg is onto, we must prove that for each a ∈ G, there is a b such that λg (b) = a. Let b = g −1 a. Now we are ready to deﬁne our group G. Let G = {λg : g ∈ G}. We must show that G is a group under composition of functions and ﬁnd an isomorphism between G and G. We have closure under composition of functions since (λg ◦ λh )(a) = λg (ha) = gha = λgh (a). Also, λe (a) = ea = a and (λg−1 ◦ λg )(a) = λg−1 (ga) = g −1 ga = a = λe (a). We can deﬁne an isomorphism from G to G by φ : g → λg . The group operation is preserved since φ(gh) = λgh = λg λh = φ(g)φ(h).

It is also one-to-one, because if φ(g)(a) = φ(h)(a), then ga = λg a = λh a = ha. Hence, g = h. That φ is onto follows from the fact that φ(g) = λg for any λg ∈ G. The isomorphism g → λg is known as the left regular representation of G. Historical Note
Arthur Cayley was born in England in 1821, though he spent much of the ﬁrst part of his life in Russia, where his father was a merchant. Cayley was educated at Cambridge, where he took the ﬁrst Smith’s Prize in mathematics. A lawyer for much of his adult life, he wrote several papers in his early twenties before entering the legal profession at the age of 25. While practicing law he continued his mathematical research, writing more than 300 papers during this period of his life. These included some of his best work. In 1863 he left law to become a professor at Cambridge. Cayley wrote more than 900 papers in ﬁelds such as group theory, geometry, and linear algebra. His legal knowledge was very valuable to Cambridge; he participated in the writing of many of the university’s statutes. Cayley was also one of the people responsible for the admission of women to Cambridge.

8.2

Direct Products

Given two groups G and H, it is possible to construct a new group from the Cartesian product of G and H, G × H. Conversely, given a large group, it is sometimes possible to decompose the group; that is, a group is sometimes isomorphic to the direct product of two smaller groups. Rather than studying a large group G, it is often easier to study the component groups of G.

External Direct Products
If (G, ·) and (H, ◦) are groups, then we can make the Cartesian product of G and H into a new group. As a set, our group is just the ordered pairs (g, h) ∈ G × H where g ∈ G and h ∈ H. We can deﬁne a binary operation on G × H by (g1 , h1 )(g2 , h2 ) = (g1 · g2 , h1 ◦ h2 );

144

CHAPTER 8

ISOMORPHISMS

that is, we just multiply elements in the ﬁrst coordinate as we do in G and elements in the second coordinate as we do in H. We have speciﬁed the particular operations · and ◦ in each group here for the sake of clarity; we usually just write (g1 , h1 )(g2 , h2 ) = (g1 g2 , h1 h2 ). Proposition 8.7 Let G and H be groups. The set G × H is a group under the operation (g1 , h1 )(g2 , h2 ) = (g1 g2 , h1 h2 ) where g1 , g2 ∈ G and h1 , h2 ∈ H. Proof. Clearly the binary operation deﬁned above is closed. If eG and eH are the identities of the groups G and H respectively, then (eG , eH ) is the identity of G × H. The inverse of (g, h) ∈ G × H is (g −1 , h−1 ). The fact that the operation is associative follows directly from the associativity of G and H. Example 7. Let R be the group of real numbers under addition. The Cartesian product of R with itself, R × R = R2 , is also a group, in which the group operation is just addition in each coordinate; that is, (a, b) + (c, d) = (a + c, b + d). The identity is (0, 0) and the inverse of (a, b) is (−a, −b). Example 8. Consider Z2 × Z2 = {(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1)}. Although Z2 × Z2 and Z4 both contain four elements, it is easy to see that they are not isomorphic since for every element (a, b) in Z2 × Z2 , (a, b) + (a, b) = (0, 0), but Z4 is cyclic. The group G × H is called the external direct product of G and H. Notice that there is nothing special about the fact that we have used only two groups to build a new group. The direct product
n

i=1

of the groups G1 , G2 , . . . , Gn is deﬁned in exactly the same manner. If G = G1 = G2 = · · · = Gn , we often write Gn instead of G1 × G2 × · · · × Gn . Example 9. The group Zn , considered as a set, is just the set of all binary 2 n-tuples. The group operation is the “exclusive or” of two binary n-tuples. For example, (01011101) + (01001011) = (00010110). This group is important in coding theory, in cryptography, and in many areas of computer science.

Theorem 8.8 Let (g, h) ∈ G × H. If g and h have ﬁnite orders r and s respectively, then the order of (g, h) in G × H is the least common multiple of r and s. Proof. Suppose that m is the least common multiple of r and s and let n = |(g, h)|. Then (g, h)m = (g m , hm ) = (eG , eH ) (g n , hn ) = (g, h)n = (eG , eH ). Hence, n must divide m, and n ≤ m. However, by the second equation, both r and s must divide n; therefore, n is a common multiple of r and s. Since m is the least common multiple of r and s, m ≤ n. Consequently, m must be equal to n. Corollary 8.9 Let (g1 , . . . , gn ) ∈ Gi . If gi has ﬁnite order ri in Gi , then the order of (g1 , . . . , gn ) in Gi is the least common multiple of r1 , . . . , rn . Example 10. Let (8, 56) ∈ Z12 × Z60 . Since gcd(8, 12) = 4, the order of 8 is 12/4 = 3 in Z12 . Similarly, the order of 56 in Z60 is 15. The least common multiple of 3 and 15 is 15; hence, (8, 56) has order 15 in Z12 × Z60 . Example 11. The group Z2 × Z3 consists of the pairs (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2). In this case, unlike that of Z2 × Z2 and Z4 , it is true that Z2 × Z3 ∼ Z6 . = We need only show that Z2 × Z3 is cyclic. It is easy to see that (1, 1) is a generator for Z2 × Z3 . The next theorem tells us exactly when the direct product of two cyclic groups is cyclic. Theorem 8.10 The group Zm × Zn is isomorphic to Zmn if and only if gcd(m, n) = 1. ∼ Proof. Assume ﬁrst that if Zm × Zn = Zmn , then gcd(m, n) = 1. To show this, we will prove the contrapositive; that is, we will show that if gcd(m, n) = d > 1, then Zm × Zn cannot be cyclic. Notice that mn/d is divisible by both m and n; hence, for any element (a, b) ∈ Zm × Zn , (a, b) + (a, b) + · · · + (a, b) = (0, 0).

Therefore, no (a, b) can generate all of Zm × Zn . The converse follows directly from Theorem 8.8 since lcm(m, n) = mn if and only if gcd(m, n) = 1. Corollary 8.11 Let n1 , . . . , nk be positive integers. Then

Internal Direct Products
The external direct product of two groups builds a large group out of two smaller groups. We would like to be able to reverse this process and conveniently break down a group into its direct product components; that is, we would like to be able to say when a group is isomorphic to the direct product of two of its subgroups. Let G be a group with subgroups H and K satisfying the following conditions. • G = HK = {hk : h ∈ H, k ∈ K}; • H ∩ K = {e}; • hk = kh for all k ∈ K and h ∈ H.

8.2

DIRECT PRODUCTS

147

Then G is the internal direct product of H and K. Example 12. The group U (8) is the internal direct product of H = {1, 3} K = {1, 5}.

Example 13. The dihedral group D6 is an internal direct product of its two subgroups H = {id, r3 } K = {id, r2 , r4 , s, r2 s, r4 s}. It can easily be shown that K ∼ S3 ; consequently, D6 ∼ Z2 × S3 . = = Example 14. Not every group can be written as the internal direct product of two of its proper subgroups. If the group S3 were an internal direct product of its proper subgroups H and K, then one of the subgroups, say H, would have to have order 3. In this case H is the subgroup {(1), (123), (132)}. The subgroup K must have order 2, but no matter which subgroup we choose for K, the condition that hk = kh will never be satisﬁed for h ∈ H and k ∈ K. Theorem 8.13 Let G be the internal direct product of subgroups H and K. Then G is isomorphic to H × K. Proof. Since G is an internal direct product, we can write any element g ∈ G as g = hk for some h ∈ H and some k ∈ K. Deﬁne a map φ : G → H × K by φ(g) = (h, k). The ﬁrst problem that we must face is to show that φ is a well-deﬁned map; that is, we must show that h and k are uniquely determined by g. Suppose that g = hk = h k . Then h−1 h = k(k )−1 is in both H and K, so it must be the identity. Therefore, h = h and k = k , which proves that φ is, indeed, well-deﬁned. To show that φ preserves the group operation, let g1 = h1 k1 and g2 = h2 k2 and observe that φ(g1 g2 ) = φ(h1 k1 h2 k2 ) = φ(h1 h2 k1 k2 ) = (h1 h2 , k1 k2 ) = (h1 , k1 )(h2 , k2 ) = φ(g1 )φ(g2 ).

CHAPTER 8

ISOMORPHISMS

We will leave the proof that φ is one-to-one and onto as an exercise. Example 15. The group Z6 is an internal direct product isomorphic to {0, 2, 4} × {0, 3}. We can extend the deﬁnition of an internal direct product of G to a collection of subgroups H1 , H2 , . . . , Hn of G, by requiring that • G = H1 H2 · · · Hn = {h1 h2 · · · hn : hi ∈ Hi }; • Hi ∩ ∪j=i Hj = {e}; • hi hj = hj hi for all hi ∈ Hi and hj ∈ Hj . We will leave the proof of the following theorem as an exercise. Theorem 8.14 Let G be the internal direct product of subgroups Hi , where i = 1, 2, . . . , n. Then G is isomorphic to i Hi .

Homomorphisms and Factor Groups

If H is a subgroup of a group G, then right cosets are not always the same as left cosets; that is, it is not always the case that gH = Hg for all g ∈ G. The subgroups for which this property holds play a critical role in group theory: they allow for the construction of a new class of groups, called factor or quotient groups. Factor groups may be studied by using homomorphisms, a generalization of isomorphisms.

9.1

Factor Groups and Normal Subgroups

Normal Subgroups
A subgroup H of a group G is normal in G if gH = Hg for all g ∈ G. That is, a normal subgroup of a group G is one in which the right and left cosets are precisely the same. Example 1. Let G be an abelian group. Every subgroup H of G is a normal subgroup. Since gh = hg for all g ∈ G and h ∈ H, it will always be the case that gH = Hg. Example 2. Let H be the subgroup of S3 consisting of elements (1) and (12). Since (123)H = {(123), (13)} and H(123) = {(123), (23)}, H cannot be a normal subgroup of S3 . However, the subgroup N , consisting of the permutations (1), (123), and (132), is normal since the cosets of N 152

153

N = {(1), (123), (132)} (12)N = N (12) = {(12), (13), (23)}.

The following theorem is fundamental to our understanding of normal subgroups. Theorem 9.1 Let G be a group and N be a subgroup of G. Then the following statements are equivalent. 1. The subgroup N is normal in G. 2. For all g ∈ G, gN g −1 ⊂ N . 3. For all g ∈ G, gN g −1 = N . Proof. (1) ⇒ (2). Since N is normal in G, gN = N g for all g ∈ G. Hence, for a given g ∈ G and n ∈ N , there exists an n in N such that gn = n g. Therefore, gng −1 = n ∈ N or gN g −1 ⊂ N . (2) ⇒ (3). Let g ∈ G. Since gN g −1 ⊂ N , we need only show N ⊂ gN g −1 . For n ∈ N , g −1 ng = g −1 n(g −1 )−1 ∈ N . Hence, g −1 ng = n for some n ∈ N . Therefore, n = gn g −1 is in gN g −1 . (3) ⇒ (1). Suppose that gN g −1 = N for all g ∈ G. Then for any n ∈ N there exists an n ∈ N such that gng −1 = n . Consequently, gn = n g or gN ⊂ N g. Similarly, N g ⊂ gN .

Factor Groups
If N is a normal subgroup of a group G, then the cosets of N in G form a group G/N under the operation (aN )(bN ) = abN . This group is called the factor or quotient group of G and N . Our ﬁrst task is to prove that G/N is indeed a group. Theorem 9.2 Let N be a normal subgroup of a group G. The cosets of N in G form a group G/N of order [G : N ]. Proof. The group operation on G/N is (aN )(bN ) = abN . This operation must be shown to be well-deﬁned; that is, group multiplication must be independent of the choice of coset representative. Let aN = bN and cN = dN . We must show that (aN )(cN ) = acN = bdN = (bN )(dN ).

154

CHAPTER 9

HOMOMORPHISMS AND FACTOR GROUPS

Then a = bn1 and c = dn2 for some n1 and n2 in N . Hence, acN = bn1 dn2 N = bn1 dN = bn1 N d = bN d = bdN. The remainder of the theorem is easy: eN = N is the identity and g −1 N is the inverse of gN . The order of G/N is, of course, the number of cosets of N in G. It is very important to remember that the elements in a factor group are sets of elements in the original group. Example 3. Consider the normal subgroup of S3 , N = {(1), (123), (132)}. The cosets of N in S3 are N and (12)N . The factor group S3 /N has the following multiplication table. N (12)N N N (12)N (12)N (12)N N

This group is isomorphic to Z2 . At ﬁrst, multiplying cosets seems both complicated and strange; however, notice that S3 /N is a smaller group. The factor group displays a certain amount of information about S3 . Actually, N = A3 , the group of even permutations, and (12)N = {(12), (13), (23)} is the set of odd permutations. The information captured in G/N is parity; that is, multiplying two even or two odd permutations results in an even permutation, whereas multiplying an odd permutation by an even permutation yields an odd permutation. Example 4. Consider the normal subgroup 3Z of Z. The cosets of 3Z in Z are 0 + 3Z = {. . . , −3, 0, 3, 6, . . .} 1 + 3Z = {. . . , −2, 1, 4, 7, . . .} 2 + 3Z = {. . . , −1, 2, 5, 8, . . .}. The group Z/3Z is given by the multiplication table below. + 0 + 3Z 1 + 3Z 2 + 3Z 0 + 3Z 0 + 3Z 1 + 3Z 2 + 3Z 1 + 3Z 1 + 3Z 2 + 3Z 0 + 3Z 2 + 3Z 2 + 3Z 0 + 3Z 1 + 3Z

GROUP HOMOMORPHISMS

In general, the subgroup nZ of Z is normal. The cosets of Z/nZ are nZ 1 + nZ 2 + nZ . . . (n − 1) + nZ. The sum of the cosets k + Z and l + Z is k + l + Z. Notice that we have written our cosets additively, because the group operation is integer addition. Example 5. Consider the dihedral group Dn , generated by the two elements r and s, satisfying the relations rn = id s2 = id srs = r−1 . The element r actually generates the cyclic subgroup of rotations, Rn , of Dn . Since srs−1 = srs = r−1 ∈ Rn , the group of rotations is a normal subgroup of Dn ; therefore, Dn /Rn is a group. Since there are exactly two elements in this group, it must be isomorphic to Z2 .

9.2

Group Homomorphisms

One of the basic ideas of algebra is the concept of a homomorphism, a natural generalization of an isomorphism. If we relax the requirement that an isomorphism of groups be bijective, we have a homomorphism. A homomorphism between groups (G, ·) and (H, ◦) is a map φ : G → H such that φ(g1 · g2 ) = φ(g1 ) ◦ φ(g2 ) for g1 , g2 ∈ G. The range of φ in H is called the homomorphic image of φ. Two groups are related in the strongest possible way if they are isomorphic; however, a weaker relationship may exist between two groups. For example, the symmetric group Sn and the group Z2 are related by the fact that Sn can be divided into even and odd permutations that exhibit a group structure like that Z2 , as shown in the following multiplication table. even odd even even odd odd odd even

156

CHAPTER 9

HOMOMORPHISMS AND FACTOR GROUPS

We use homomorphisms to study relationships such as the one we have just described. Example 6. Let G be a group and g ∈ G. Deﬁne a map φ : Z → G by φ(n) = g n . Then φ is a group homomorphism, since φ(m + n) = g m+n = g m g n = φ(m)φ(n). This homomorphism maps Z onto the cyclic subgroup of G generated by g. Example 7. Let G = GL2 (R). If A= a b c d

is in G, then the determinant is nonzero; that is, det(A) = ad − bc = 0. Also, for any two elements A and B in G, det(AB) = det(A) det(B). Using the determinant, we can deﬁne a homomorphism φ : GL2 (R) → R∗ by A → det(A). Example 8. Recall that the circle group T consists of all complex numbers z such that |z| = 1. We can deﬁne a homomorphism φ from the additive group of real numbers R to T by φ : θ → cos θ + i sin θ. Indeed, φ(α + β) = cos(α + β) + i sin(α + β) = (cos α cos β − sin α sin β) + i(sin α cos β + cos α sin β) = (cos α + i sin α) + (cos β + i sin β) = φ(α)φ(β). Geometrically, we are simply wrapping the real line around the circle in a group-theoretic fashion. The following proposition lists some basic properties of group homomorphisms. Proposition 9.3 Let φ : G1 → G2 be a homomorphism of groups. Then 1. If e is the identity of G1 , then φ(e) is the identity of G2 ; 2. For any element g ∈ G1 , φ(g −1 ) = [φ(g)]−1 ; 3. If H1 is a subgroup of G1 , then φ(H1 ) is a subgroup of G2 ;

9.2

4. If H2 is a subgroup of G2 , then φ−1 (H2 ) = {g ∈ G : φ(g) ∈ H2 } is a subgroup of G1 . Furthermore, if H2 is normal in G2 , then φ−1 (H2 ) is normal in G1 . Proof. (1) Suppose that e and e are the identities of G1 and G2 , respectively; then e φ(e) = φ(e) = φ(ee) = φ(e)φ(e). By cancellation, φ(e) = e . (2) This statement follows from the fact that φ(g −1 )φ(g) = φ(g −1 g) = φ(e) = e. (3) The set φ(H1 ) is nonempty since the identity of H2 is in φ(H1 ). Suppose that H1 is a subgroup of G1 and let x and y be in φ(H1 ). There exist elements a, b ∈ H1 such that φ(a) = x and φ(b) = y. Since xy −1 = φ(a)[φ(b)]−1 = φ(ab−1 ) ∈ φ(H1 ), φ(H1 ) is a subgroup of G2 by Proposition 2.10. (4) Let H2 be a subgroup of G2 and deﬁne H1 to be φ−1 (H2 ); that is, H1 is the set of all g ∈ G1 such that φ(g) ∈ H2 . The identity is in H1 since φ(e) = e. If a and b are in H1 , then φ(ab−1 ) = φ(a)[φ(b)]−1 is in H2 since H2 is a subgroup of G2 . Therefore, ab−1 ∈ H1 and H1 is a subgroup of G1 . If H2 is normal in G2 , we must show that g −1 hg ∈ H1 for h ∈ H1 and g ∈ G1 . But φ(g −1 hg) = [φ(g)]−1 φ(h)φ(g) ∈ H2 , since H2 is a normal subgroup of G2 . Therefore, g −1 hg ∈ H1 . Let φ : G → H be a group homomorphism and suppose that e is the identity of H. By Proposition 9.3, φ−1 ({e}) is a subgroup of G. This subgroup is called the kernel of φ and will be denoted by ker φ. In fact, this subgroup is a normal subgroup of G since the trivial subgroup is normal in H. We state this result in the following theorem, which says that with every homomorphism of groups we can naturally associate a normal subgroup. Theorem 9.4 Let φ : G → H be a group homomorphism. Then the kernel of φ is a normal subgroup of G. Example 9. Let us examine the homomorphism φ : GL2 (R) → R∗ deﬁned by A → det(A). Since 1 is the identity of R∗ , the kernel of this homomorphism is all 2×2 matrices having determinant one. That is, ker φ = SL2 (R).

158

CHAPTER 9

HOMOMORPHISMS AND FACTOR GROUPS

Example 10. The kernel of the group homomorphism φ : R → C∗ deﬁned by φ(θ) = cos θ + i sin θ is {2πn : n ∈ Z}. Notice that ker φ ∼ Z. = Example 11. Suppose that we wish to determine all possible homomorphisms φ from Z7 to Z12 . Since the kernel of φ must be a subgroup of Z7 , there are only two possible kernels, {0} and all of Z7 . The image of a subgroup of Z7 must be a subgroup of Z12 . Hence, there is no injective homomorphism; otherwise, Z12 would have a subgroup of order 7, which is impossible. Consequently, the only possible homomorphism from Z7 to Z12 is the one mapping all elements to zero. Example 12. Let G be a group. Suppose that g ∈ G and φ is the homomorphism from Z to G given by φ(n) = g n . If the order of g is inﬁnite, then the kernel of this homomorphism is {0} since φ maps Z onto the cyclic subgroup of G generated by g. However, if the order of g is ﬁnite, say n, then the kernel of φ is nZ.

Simplicity of An
Of special interest are groups with no nontrivial normal subgroups. Such groups are called simple groups. Of course, we already have a whole class of examples of simple groups, Zp , where p is prime. These groups are trivially simple since they have no proper subgroups other than the subgroup consisting solely of the identity. Other examples of simple groups are not so easily found. We can, however, show that the alternating group, An , is simple for n ≥ 5. The proof of this result requires several lemmas. Lemma 9.5 The alternating group An is generated by 3-cycles for n ≥ 3. Proof. To show that the 3-cycles generate An , we need only show that any pair of transpositions can be written as the product of 3-cycles. Since (ab) = (ba), every pair of transpositions must be one of the following: (ab)(ab) = id (ab)(cd) = (acb)(acd) (ab)(ac) = (acb).

Lemma 9.6 Let N be a normal subgroup of An , where n ≥ 3. If N contains a 3-cycle, then N = An .

9.2

GROUP HOMOMORPHISMS

159

Proof. We will ﬁrst show that An is generated by 3-cycles of the speciﬁc form (ijk), where i and j are ﬁxed in {1, 2, . . . , n} and we let k vary. Every 3-cycle is the product of 3-cycles of this form, since (iaj) = (ija)2 (iab) = (ijb)(ija)2 (jab) = (ijb)2 (ija) (abc) = (ija)2 (ijc)(ijb)2 (ija). Now suppose that N is a nontrivial normal subgroup of An for n ≥ 3 such that N contains a 3-cycle of the form (ija). Using the normality of N , we see that [(ij)(ak)](ija)2 [(ij)(ak)]−1 = (ijk) is in N . Hence, N must contain all of the 3-cycles (ijk) for 1 ≤ k ≤ n. By Lemma 9.5, these 3-cycles generate An ; hence, N = An . Lemma 9.7 For n ≥ 5, every normal subgroup N of An contains a 3-cycle. Proof. Let σ be an arbitrary element in a normal subgroup N . There are several possible cycle structures for σ. • σ is a 3-cycle. • σ is the product of disjoint cycles, σ = τ (a1 a2 · · · ar ) ∈ N , where r > 3. • σ is the product of disjoint cycles, σ = τ (a1 a2 a3 )(a4 a5 a6 ). • σ = τ (a1 a2 a3 ), where τ is the product of disjoint 2-cycles. • σ = τ (a1 a2 )(a3 a4 ), where τ is the product of an even number of disjoint 2-cycles. If σ is a 3-cycle, then we are done. If N contains a product of disjoint cycles, σ, and at least one of these cycles has length greater than 3, say σ = τ (a1 a2 · · · ar ), then (a1 a2 a3 )σ(a1 a2 a3 )−1 is in N since N is normal; hence, σ −1 (a1 a2 a3 )σ(a1 a2 a3 )−1

is also in N . Since σ −1 (a1 a2 a3 )σ(a1 a2 a3 )−1 = σ −1 (a1 a2 a3 )σ(a1 a3 a2 ) = (a1 a2 · · · ar )−1 τ −1 (a1 a2 a3 )τ (a1 a2 · · · ar )(a1 a3 a2 ) = (a1 ar ar−1 · · · a2 )(a1 a2 a3 )(a1 a2 · · · ar )(a1 a3 a2 ) = (a1 a3 ar ), N must contain a 3-cycle; hence, N = An . Now suppose that N contains a disjoint product of the form σ = τ (a1 a2 a3 )(a4 a5 a6 ). Then σ −1 (a1 a2 a4 )σ(a1 a2 a4 )−1 ∈ N since (a1 a2 a4 )σ(a1 a2 a4 )−1 ∈ N. So σ −1 (a1 a2 a4 )σ(a1 a2 a4 )−1 = [τ (a1 a2 a3 )(a4 a5 a6 )]−1 (a1 a2 a4 )τ (a1 a2 a3 )(a4 a5 a6 )(a1 a2 a4 )−1 = (a4 a6 a5 )(a1 a3 a2 )τ −1 (a1 a2 a4 )τ (a1 a2 a3 )(a4 a5 a6 )(a1 a4 a2 ) = (a4 a6 a5 )(a1 a3 a2 )(a1 a2 a4 )(a1 a2 a3 )(a4 a5 a6 )(a1 a4 a2 ) = (a1 a4 a2 a6 a3 ). So N contains a disjoint cycle of length greater than 3, and we can apply the previous case. Suppose N contains a disjoint product of the form σ = τ (a1 a2 a3 ), where τ is the product of disjoint 2-cycles. Since σ ∈ N , σ 2 ∈ N , and σ 2 = τ (a1 a2 a3 )τ (a1 a2 a3 ) = (a1 a3 a2 ). So N contains a 3-cycle. The only remaining possible case is a disjoint product of the form σ = τ (a1 a2 )(a3 a4 ), where τ is the product of an even number of disjoint 2-cycles. But σ −1 (a1 a2 a3 )σ(a1 a2 a3 )−1

9.2

GROUP HOMOMORPHISMS

is in N since (a1 a2 a3 )σ(a1 a2 a3 )−1 is in N ; and so σ −1 (a1 a2 a3 )σ(a1 a2 a3 )−1 = τ −1 (a1 a2 )(a3 a4 )(a1 a2 a3 )τ (a1 a2 )(a3 a4 )(a1 a2 a3 )−1 = (a1 a3 )(a2 a4 ). Since n ≥ 5, we can ﬁnd b ∈ {1, 2, . . . , n} such that b = a1 , a2 , a3 , a4 . Let µ = (a1 a3 b). Then µ−1 (a1 a3 )(a2 a4 )µ(a1 a3 )(a2 a4 ) ∈ N and µ−1 (a1 a3 )(a2 a4 )µ(a1 a3 )(a2 a4 ) = (a1 ba3 )(a1 a3 )(a2 a4 )(a1 a3 b)(a1 a3 )(a2 a4 ) = (a1 a3 b). Therefore, N contains a 3-cycle. This completes the proof of the lemma. Theorem 9.8 The alternating group, An , is simple for n ≥ 5. Proof. Let N be a normal subgroup of An . By Lemma 9.7, N contains a 3cycle. By Lemma 9.6, N = An ; therefore, An contains no proper nontrivial normal subgroups for n ≥ 5. Historical Note
One of the foremost problems of group theory has been to classify all simple ﬁnite groups. This problem is over a century old and has been solved only in the last few years. In a sense, ﬁnite simple groups are the building blocks of all ﬁnite groups. The ﬁrst nonabelian simple groups to be discovered were the alternating groups. Galois was the ﬁrst to prove that A5 was simple. Later mathematicians, such as C. Jordan and L. E. Dickson, found several inﬁnite families of matrix groups that were simple. Other families of simple groups were discovered in the 1950s. At the turn of the century, William Burnside conjectured that all nonabelian simple groups must have even order. In 1963, W. Feit and J. Thompson proved Burnside’s conjecture and published their results in the paper “Solvability of Groups of Odd Order,” which appeared in the Paciﬁc Journal of Mathematics. Their proof, running over 250 pages, gave impetus to a program in the 1960s and 1970s to classify all ﬁnite simple groups. Daniel Gorenstein was the organizer of this remarkable eﬀort. One of the last simple groups was the “Monster,” discovered by R. Greiss. The Monster, a 196,833 × 196,833 matrix group, is one of the 26 sporadic, or special, simple groups. These sporadic simple groups are groups that ﬁt into no inﬁnite family of simple groups.

The Isomorphism Theorems

Though at ﬁrst it is not evident that factor groups correspond exactly to homomorphic images, we can use factor groups to study homomorphisms. We already know that with every group homomorphism φ : G → H we can associate a normal subgroup of G, ker φ; the converse is also true. Every normal subgroup of a group G gives rise to homomorphism of groups. Let H be a normal subgroup of G. Deﬁne the natural or canonical homomorphism φ : G → G/H by φ(g) = gH. This is indeed a homomorphism, since φ(g1 g2 ) = g1 g2 H = g1 Hg2 H = φ(g1 )φ(g2 ). The kernel of this homomorphism is H. The following theorems describe the relationships among group homomorphisms, normal subgroups, and factor groups. Theorem 9.9 (First Isomorphism Theorem) If ψ : G → H is a group homomorphism with K = ker ψ, then K is normal in G. Let φ : G → G/K be the canonical homomorphism. Then there exists a unique isomorphism η : G/K → ψ(G) such that ψ = ηφ. Proof. We already know that K is normal in G. Deﬁne η : G/K → ψ(G) by η(gK) = ψ(g). We must ﬁrst show that this is a well-deﬁned map. Suppose that g1 K = g2 K. For some k ∈ K, g1 k = g2 ; consequently, η(g1 K) = ψ(g1 ) = ψ(g1 )ψ(k) = ψ(g1 k) = ψ(g2 ) = η(g2 K). Since η(g1 K) = η(g2 K), η does not depend on the choice of coset representative. Clearly η is onto ψ(G). To show that η is one-to-one, suppose that −1 η(g1 K) = η(g2 K). Then ψ(g1 ) = ψ(g2 ). This implies that ψ(g1 g2 ) = e, −1 −1 or g1 g2 is in the kernel of ψ; hence, g1 g2 K = K; that is, g1 K = g2 K. Finally, we must show that η is a homomorphism, but η(g1 Kg2 K) = η(g1 g2 K) = ψ(g1 g2 ) = ψ(g1 )ψ(g2 ) = η(g1 K)η(g2 K).

Example 13. Let G be a cyclic group with generator g. Deﬁne a map φ : Z → G by n → g n . This map is a surjective homomorphism since φ(m + n) = g m+n = g m g n = φ(m)φ(n). Clearly φ is onto. If |g| = m, then g m = e. Hence, ker φ = mZ and Z/ ker φ = Z/mZ ∼ G. On the other hand, if the order of g is inﬁnite, then = ker φ = 0 and φ is an isomorphism of G and Z. Hence, two cyclic groups are isomorphic exactly when they have the same order. Up to isomorphism, the only cyclic groups are Z and Zn . Theorem 9.10 (Second Isomorphism Theorem) Let H be a subgroup of a group G (not necessarily normal in G) and N a normal subgroup of G. Then HN is a subgroup of G, H ∩ N is a normal subgroup of H, and H/H ∩ N ∼ HN/N. = Proof. We will ﬁrst show that HN = {hn : h ∈ H, n ∈ N } is a subgroup of G. Suppose that h1 n1 , h2 n2 ∈ HN . Since N is normal, (h2 )−1 n1 h2 ∈ N . So (h1 n1 )(h2 n2 ) = h1 h2 ((h2 )−1 n1 h2 )n2 is in HN . The inverse of hn ∈ HN is in HN since (hn)−1 = n−1 h−1 = h−1 (hn−1 h−1 ). Next, we prove that H ∩ N is normal in H. Let h ∈ H and n ∈ H ∩ N . Then h−1 nh ∈ H since each element is in H. Also, h−1 nh ∈ N since N is normal in G; therefore, h−1 nh ∈ H ∩ N .

HOMOMORPHISMS AND FACTOR GROUPS

Now deﬁne a map φ from H to HN/N by h → hN . The map φ is onto, since any coset hnN = hN is the image of h in H. We also know that φ is a homomorphism because φ(hh ) = hh N = hN h N = φ(h)φ(h ). By the First Isomorphism Theorem, the image of φ is isomorphic to H/ ker φ; that is, HN/N = φ(H) ∼ H/ ker φ. = Since ker φ = {h ∈ H : h ∈ N } = H ∩ N, HN/N = φ(H) ∼ H/H ∩ N . = Theorem 9.11 (Correspondence Theorem) Let N be a normal subgroup of a group G. Then H → H/N is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of subgroups H containing N and the set of subgroups of G/N . Furthermore, the normal subgroups of H correspond to normal subgroups of G/N . Proof. Let H be a subgroup of G containing N . Since N is normal in H, H/N makes sense. Let aN and bN be elements of H/N . Then (aN )(b−1 N ) = ab−1 N ∈ H/N ; hence, H/N is a subgroup of G/N . Let S be a subgroup of G/N . This subgroup is a set of cosets of N . If H = {g ∈ G : gN ∈ S}, then for h1 , h2 ∈ H, we have that (h1 N )(h2 N ) = hh N ∈ S and h−1 N ∈ S. Therefore, H must be a subgroup of G. Clearly, 1 H contains N . Therefore, S = H/N . Consequently, the map H → H/H is onto. Suppose that H1 and H2 are subgroups of G containing N such that H1 /N = H2 /N . If h1 ∈ H1 , then h1 N ∈ H1 /N . Hence, h1 N = h2 N ⊂ H2 for some h2 in H2 . However, since N is contained in H2 , we know that h1 ∈ H2 or H1 ⊂ H2 . Similarly, H2 ⊂ H1 . Since H1 = H2 , the map H → H/H is one-to-one. Suppose that H is normal in G and N is a subgroup of H. Then it is easy to verify that the map G/N → G/H deﬁned by gN → gH is a homomorphism. The kernel of this homomorphism is H/N , which proves that H/N is normal in G/N . Conversely, suppose that H/N is normal in G/N . The homomorphism given by G/N G → G/N → H/N

Notice that in the course of the proof of Theorem 9.11, we have also proved the following theorem. Theorem 9.12 (Third Isomorphism Theorem) Let G be a group and N and H be normal subgroups of G with N ⊂ H. Then G/N G/H ∼ . = H/N Example 14. By the Third Isomorphism Theorem, Z/mZ ∼ (Z/mnZ)/(mZ/mnZ). = Since |Z/mnZ| = mn and |Z/mZ| = m, we have |mZ/mnZ| = n.

Matrix Groups and Symmetry

When Felix Klein (1849–1925) accepted a chair at the University of Erlangen, he outlined in his inaugural address a program to classify diﬀerent geometries. Central to Klein’s program was the theory of groups: he considered geometry to be the study of properties that are left invariant under transformation groups. Groups, especially matrix groups, have now become important in the study of symmetry and have found applications in such disciplines as chemistry and physics. In the ﬁrst part of this chapter, we will examine some of the classical matrix groups, such as the general linear group, the special linear group, and the orthogonal group. We will then use these matrix groups to investigate some of the ideas behind geometric symmetry.

10.1

Matrix Groups

Some Facts from Linear Algebra
Before we study matrix groups, we must recall some basic facts from linear algebra. One of the most fundamental ideas of linear algebra is that of a linear transformation. A linear transformation or linear map T : Rn → Rm is a map that preserves vector addition and scalar multiplication; that is, for vectors x and y in Rn and a scalar α ∈ R, T (x + y) = T (x) + T (y) T (αy) = αT (y). An m × n matrix with entries in R represents a linear transformation from Rn to Rm . If we write vectors x = (x1 , . . . , xn )t and y = (y1 , . . . , yn )t in Rn 170

maps the vectors to Rm linearly by matrix multiplication. Observe that if α is a real number, A(x + y) = Ax + Ay αAx = A(αx), where    x=  x1 x2 . . . xn We will often abbreviate the matrix A by writing (aij ). Conversely, if T : Rn → Rm is a linear map, we can associate a matrix A with T by considering what T does to the vectors e1 = (1, 0, . . . , 0)t e2 = (0, 1, . . . , 0)t . . . en = (0, 0, . . . , 1)t . We can write any vector x = (x1 , . . . , xn )t as x1 e1 + x2 e2 + · · · + xn en . Consequently, if T (e1 ) = (a11 , a21 , . . . , am1 )t , T (e2 ) = (a12 , a22 , . . . , am2 )t , . . . T (en ) = (a1n , a2n , . . . , amn )t ,    . 

= Ax. Example 1. If we let T : R2 → R2 be the map given by T (x1 , x2 ) = (2x1 + 5x2 , −4x1 + 3x2 ), the axioms that T must satisfy to be a linear transformation are easily veriﬁed. The column vectors T e1 = (2, −4)t and T e2 = (5, 3)t tell us that T is given by the matrix A= 2 5 −4 3 .

Since we are interested in groups of matrices, we need to know which matrices have multiplicative inverses. Recall that an n × n matrix A is invertible exactly when there exists another matrix A−1 such that AA−1 = A−1 A = I, where   1 0 ··· 0  0 1 ··· 0    I= . . . . . .. .  .   . . . 0 0 ··· 1 is the n×n identity matrix. From linear algebra we know that A is invertible if and only if the determinant of A is nonzero. Sometimes an invertible matrix is said to be nonsingular. Example 2. If A is the matrix 2 1 5 3 then the inverse of A is A−1 = 3 −1 −5 2 . ,

10.1

MATRIX GROUPS

173

We are guaranteed that A−1 exists, since det(A) = 2 · 3 − 5 · 1 = 1 is nonzero. Some other facts about determinants will also prove useful in the course of this chapter. Let A and B be n × n matrices. From linear algebra we have the following properties of determinants. • The determinant is a homomorphism into the multiplicative group of real numbers; that is, det(AB) = (det A)(det B). • If A is an invertible matrix, then det(A−1 ) = 1/ det A. • If we deﬁne the transpose of a matrix A = (aij ) to be At = (aji ), then det(At ) = det A. • Let T be the linear transformation associated with an n × n matrix A. Then T multiplies volumes by a factor of | det A|. In the case of R2 , this means that T multiplies areas by | det A|. Linear maps, matrices, and determinants are covered in any elementary linear algebra text; however, if you have not had a course in linear algebra, it is a straightforward process to verify these properties directly for 2 × 2 matrices, the case with which we are most concerned.

The General and Special Linear Groups
The set of all n × n invertible matrices forms a group called the general linear group. We will denote this group by GLn (R). The general linear group has several important subgroups. The multiplicative properties of the determinant imply that the set of matrices with determinant one is a subgroup of the general linear group. Stated another way, suppose that det(A) = 1 and det(B) = 1. Then det(AB) = det(A) det(B) = 1 and det(A−1 ) = 1/ det A = 1. This subgroup is called the special linear group and is denoted by SLn (R). Example 3. Given a 2 × 2 matrix A= a b c d ,

the determinant of A is ad − bc. The group GL2 (R) consists of those matrices in which ad − bc = 0. The inverse of A is A−1 = 1 ad − bc d −b −c a .

174

CHAPTER 10

MATRIX GROUPS AND SYMMETRY

If A is in SL2 (R), then A−1 = d −b −c a .

Geometrically, SL2 (R) is the group that preserves the areas of parallelograms. Let 1 1 A= 0 1 be in SL2 (R). In Figure 10.1, the unit square corresponding to the vectors x = (1, 0)t and y = (0, 1)t is taken by A to the parallelogram with sides (1, 0)t and (1, 1)t ; that is, Ax = (1, 0)t and Ay = (1, 1)t . Notice that these two parallelograms have the same area.

The Orthogonal Group O(n)
Another subgroup of GLn (R) is the orthogonal group. A matrix A is orthogonal if A−1 = At . The orthogonal group consists of the set of all orthogonal matrices. We write O(n) for the n × n orthogonal group. We leave as an exercise the proof that O(n) is a subgroup of GLn (R). Example 4. The following matrices are orthogonal: √ √   √ −1/ 2 0√ 1/√2 √ 3/5 −4/5 1/2 − 3/2 √ , ,  1/√6 −2/ 6 1/√6  . √ 4/5 3/5 3/2 1/2 1/ 3 1/ 3 1/ 3

There is a more geometric way of viewing the group O(n). The orthogonal matrices are exactly those matrices that preserve the length of vectors.

10.1

MATRIX GROUPS

175

We can deﬁne the length of a vector using the Euclidean inner product, or dot product, of two vectors. The Euclidean inner product of two vectors x = (x1 , . . . , xn )t and y = (y1 , . . . , yn )t is   y1  y2    x, y = xt y = (x1 , x2 , . . . , xn )  .  = x1 y1 + · · · + xn yn . .   . yn We deﬁne the length of a vector x = (x1 , . . . , xn )t to be x = x, x = x2 + · · · + x2 . n 1

Associated with the notion of the length of a vector is the idea of the distance between two vectors. We deﬁne the distance between two vectors x and y to be x − y . We leave as an exercise the proof of the following proposition about the properties of Euclidean inner products. Proposition 10.1 Let x, y, and w be vectors in Rn and α ∈ R. Then 1. x, y = y, x . 2. x, y + w = x, y + x, w . 3. αx, y = x, αy = α x, y . 4. x, x ≥ 0 with equality exactly when x = 0. 5. If x, y = 0 for all x in Rn , then y = 0. Example 5. The vector x = (3, 4)t has length see that the orthogonal matrix A= 3/5 −4/5 4/5 3/5 √ 32 + 42 = 5. We can also

preserves the length of this vector. The vector Ax = (−7/5, 24/5)t also has length 5. Since det(AAt ) = det(I) = 1 and det(A) = det(At ), the determinant of any orthogonal matrix is either 1 or −1. Consider the column vectors   a1j  a2j    aj =  .  .   . anj

is the Kronecker delta. Accordingly, column vectors of an orthogonal matrix all have length 1; and the Euclidean inner product of distinct column vectors is zero. Any set of vectors satisfying these properties is called an orthonormal set. Conversely, given an n × n matrix A whose columns form an orthonormal set, A−1 = At . We say that a matrix A is distance-preserving, length-preserving, or inner product-preserving when T x−T y = x−y , T x = x , or T x, T y = x, y , respectively. The following theorem, which characterizes the orthogonal group, says that these notions are the same. Theorem 10.2 Let A be an n × n matrix. The following statements are equivalent. 1. The columns of the matrix A form an orthonormal set. 2. A−1 = At . 3. For vectors x and y, Ax, Ay = x, y . 4. For vectors x and y, Ax − Ay = x − y . 5. For any vector x, Ax = x . Proof. We have already shown (1) and (2) to be equivalent. (2) ⇒ (3). Ax, Ay = (Ax)t Ay = xt At Ay = xt y = (3) ⇒ (2). Since x, x = = Ax, Ax x, At Ax , x, y .

we know that x, (At A − I)x = 0 for all x. Therefore, At A − I = 0 or A−1 = At . (3) ⇒ (4). If A is inner product-preserving, then A is distance-preserving, since Ax − Ay

We use the following identity to show that length-preserving implies inner product-preserving: x, y = Observe that Ax, Ay = = = = 1 Ax + Ay 2 − Ax 2 − Ay 2 1 A(x + y) 2 − Ax 2 − Ay 2 1 x+y 2− x 2− y 2 2 x, y .

Example 6. Let us examine the orthogonal group on R2 a bit more closely. An element T ∈ O(2) is determined by its action on e1 = (1, 0)t and e2 = (0, 1)t . If T (e1 ) = (a, b)t , then a2 + b2 = 1 and T (e2 ) = (−b, a)t . Hence, T can be represented by A= a −b b a = cos θ − sin θ sin θ cos θ ,

where 0 ≤ θ < 2π. A matrix T in O(2) either reﬂects or rotates a vector in R2 (Figure 10.2). A reﬂection is given by the matrix 1 0 0 −1 ,

Two of the other matrix or matrix-related groups that we will consider are the special orthogonal group and the group of Euclidean motions. The special orthogonal group, SO(n), is just the intersection of O(n) and SLn (R); that is, those elements in O(n) with determinant one. The Euclidean group, E(n), can be written as ordered pairs (A, x), where A is in O(n) and x is in Rn . We deﬁne multiplication by (A, x)(B, y) = (AB, Ay + x). The identity of the group is (I, 0); the inverse of (A, x) is (A−1 , −A−1 x). In Exercise 6, you are asked to check that E(n) is indeed a group under this operation.

Symmetry

An isometry or rigid motion in Rn is a distance-preserving function f from Rn to Rn . This means that f must satisfy f (x) − f (y) = x − y for all x, y ∈ Rn . It is not diﬃcult to show that f must be a one-to-one map. By Theorem 10.2, any element in O(n) is an isometry on Rn ; however, O(n) does not include all possible isometries on Rn . Translation by a vector x, Ty (x) = x + y is also an isometry (Figure 10.3); however, T cannot be in O(n) since it is not a linear map. We are mostly interested in isometries in R2 . In fact, the only isometries in R2 are rotations and reﬂections about the origin, translations, and combinations of the two. For example, a glide reﬂection is a translation followed by a reﬂection (Figure 10.4). In Rn all isometries are given in the same manner. The proof is very easy to generalize.

f (x), f (y) = x, y . Now let e1 and e2 be (1, 0)t and (0, 1)t , respectively. If

x = (x1 , x2 ) = x1 e1 + x2 e2 , then f (x) = f (x), f (e1 ) f (e1 ) + f (x), f (e2 ) f (e2 ) = x1 f (e1 ) + x2 f (e2 ). The linearity of f easily follows. For any arbitrary isometry, f , Tx f will ﬁx the origin for some vector x in R2 ; hence, Tx f (y) = Ay for some matrix A ∈ O(2). Consequently, f (y) = Ay + x. Given the isometries f (y) = Ay + x1 g(y) = By + x2 , their composition is f (g(y)) = f (By + x2 ) = ABy + Ax2 + x1 . This last computation allows us to identify the group of isometries on R2 with E(2). Theorem 10.4 The group of isometries on R2 is the Euclidean group, E(2). A symmetry group in Rn is a subgroup of the group of isometries on Rn that ﬁxes a set of points X ⊂ R2 . It is important to realize that the symmetry group of X depends both on Rn and on X. For example, the symmetry group of the origin in R1 is Z2 , but the symmetry group of the origin in R2 is O(2). Theorem 10.5 The only ﬁnite symmetry groups in R2 are Zn and Dn . Proof. Any ﬁnite symmetry group G in R2 must be a ﬁnite subgroup of O(2); otherwise, G would have an element in E(2) of the form (A, x), where x = 0. Such an element must have inﬁnite order. By Example 6, elements in O(2) are either rotations of the form Rθ = cos θ − sin θ sin θ cos θ

or reﬂections of the form Tθ = cos θ − sin θ sin θ cos θ .

2 Notice that det(Rθ ) = 1, det(Tθ ) = −1, and Tθ = I. We can divide the proof up into two cases. In the ﬁrst case, all of the elements in G have determinant one. In the second case, there exists at least one element in G with determinant −1. Case 1. The determinant of every element in G is one. In this case every element in G must be a rotation. Since G is ﬁnite, there is a smallest angle, say θ0 , such that the corresponding element Rθ0 is the smallest rotation in the positive direction. We claim that Rθ0 generates G. If not, then for some positive integer n there is an angle θ1 between nθ0 and (n + 1)θ0 . If so, then (n + 1)θ0 − θ1 corresponds to a rotation smaller than θ0 , which contradicts the minimality of θ0 . Case 2. The group G contains a reﬂection Tθ . The kernel of the homomorphism φ : G → {−1, 1} given by A → det(A) consists of elements whose determinant is 1. Therefore, |G/ ker φ| = 2. We know that the kernel is cyclic by the ﬁrst case and is a subgroup of G of, say, order n. Hence, |G| = 2n. The elements of G are n−1 n−1 Rθ , . . . , Rθ , T Rθ , . . . , T Rθ .

These elements satisfy the relation
−1 T Rθ T = Rθ .

Consequently, G must be isomorphic to Dn in this case.

MATRIX GROUPS AND SYMMETRY

The Wallpaper Groups
Suppose that we wish to study wallpaper patterns in the plane or crystals in three dimensions. Wallpaper patterns are simply repeating patterns in the plane (Figure 10.5). The analogs of wallpaper patterns in R3 are crystals, which we can think of as repeating patterns of molecules in three dimensions (Figure 10.6). The mathematical equivalent of a wallpaper or crystal pattern is called a lattice.

Figure 10.6. A crystal structure in R3 Let us examine wallpaper patterns in the plane a little more closely. Suppose that x and y are linearly independent vectors in R2 ; that is, one vector cannot be a scalar multiple of the other. A lattice of x and y is the set of all linear combinations mx + ny, where m and n are integers. The vectors x and y are said to be a basis for the lattice.

10.2

SYMMETRY

183

Given two bases for the same lattice, say {x1 , x2 } and {y1 , y2 }, we can write y1 = α1 x1 + α2 x2 y2 = β1 x1 + β2 x2 , where α1 , α2 , β1 , and β2 are integers. The matrix corresponding to this transformation is α1 α2 U= . β1 β2 If we wish to give x1 and x2 in terms of y1 and y2 , we need only calculate U −1 ; that is, y1 x1 U −1 = . y2 x2 Since U has integer entries, U −1 must also have integer entries; hence the determinants of both U and U −1 must be integers. Because U U −1 = I, det(U U −1 ) = det(U ) det(U −1 ) = 1; consequently, det(U ) = ±1. A matrix with determinant ±1 and integer entries is called unimodular. For example, the matrix 3 1 5 2 is unimodular. It should be clear that there is a minimum length for vectors in a lattice. We can classify lattices by studying their symmetry groups. The symmetry group of a lattice is the subgroup of E(2) that maps the lattice to itself. We consider two lattices in R2 to be equivalent if they have the same symmetry group. Similarly, classiﬁcation of crystals in R3 is accomplished by associating a symmetry group, called a space group, with each type of crystal. Two lattices are considered diﬀerent if their space groups are not the same. The natural question that now arises is how many space groups exist. A space group is composed of two parts: a translation subgroup and a point group. The translation subgroup is an inﬁnite abelian subgroup of the space group made up of the translational symmetries of the crystal; the point group is a ﬁnite group consisting of rotations and reﬂections of the crystal about a point. More speciﬁcally, a space group is a subgroup of G ⊂ E(2) whose translations are a set of the form {(I, t) : t ∈ L}, where L is

a lattice. Space groups are, of course, inﬁnite. Using geometric arguments, we can prove the following theorem (see [5] or [6]). Theorem 10.6 Every translation group in R2 is isomorphic to Z × Z.

Figure 10.8. Types of lattices in R2 The point group of G is G0 = {A : (A, b) ∈ G for some b}. In particular, G0 must be a subgroup of O(2). Suppose that x is a vector in a lattice L with space group G, translation group H, and point group G0 . For any element (A, y) in G, (A, y)(I, x)(A, y)−1 = (A, Ax + y)(A−1 , −A−1 y) = (AA−1 , −AA−1 y + Ax + y) = (I, Ax); hence, (I, Ax) is in the translation group of G. More speciﬁcally, Ax must be in the lattice L. It is important to note that G0 is not usually a subgroup of the space group G; however, if T is the translation subgroup of G, then G/T ∼ G0 . The proof of the following theorem can be found in [2], [5], = or [6]. Theorem 10.7 The point group in the wallpaper groups is isomorphic to Zn or Dn , where n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 6. To answer the question of how the point groups and the translation groups can be combined, we must look at the diﬀerent types of lattices. Lattices can be classiﬁed by the structure of a single lattice cell. The possible cell shapes are parallelogram, rectangular, square, rhombic, and hexagonal

theorem can be found in several of the references at the end of this chapter, including [5], [6], [10], and [11]. Historical Note
Symmetry groups have intrigued mathematicians for a long time. Leonardo da Vinci was probably the ﬁrst person to know all of the point groups. At the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1900, David Hilbert gave a now-famous address outlining 23 problems to guide mathematics in the twentieth century. Hilbert’s eighteenth problem asked whether or not crystallographic groups in n dimensions were always ﬁnite. In 1910, L. Bieberbach proved that crystallographic groups are ﬁnite in every dimension. Finding out how many of these groups there are in each dimension is another matter. In R3 there are 230 diﬀerent space groups; in R4 there are 4783. No one has been able to compute the number of space groups for R5 and beyond. It is interesting to note that the crystallographic groups were found mathematically for R3 before the 230 diﬀerent types of crystals were actually discovered in nature.

The Structure of Groups

The ultimate goal of group theory is to classify all groups up to isomorphism; that is, given a particular group, we should be able to match it up with a known group via an isomorphism. For example, we have already proved that any ﬁnite cyclic group of order n is isomorphic to Zn ; hence, we “know” all ﬁnite cyclic groups. It is probably not reasonable to expect that we will ever know all groups; however, we can often classify certain types of groups or distinguish between groups in special cases. In this chapter we will characterize all ﬁnite abelian groups. We shall also investigate groups with sequences of subgroups. If a group has a sequence of subgroups, say G = Hn ⊃ Hn−1 ⊃ · · · ⊃ H1 ⊃ H0 = {e}, where each subgroup Hi is normal in Hi+1 and each of the factor groups Hi+1 /Hi is abelian, then G is a solvable group. In addition to allowing us to distinguish between certain classes of groups, solvable groups turn out to be central to the study of solutions to polynomial equations.

11.1

Finite Abelian Groups

In our investigation of cyclic groups we found that every group of prime order was isomorphic to Zp , where p was a prime number. We also determined that Zmn ∼ Zm × Zn when gcd(m, n) = 1. In fact, much more is true. = Every ﬁnite abelian group is isomorphic to a direct product of cyclic groups of prime power order; that is, every ﬁnite abelian group is isomorphic to a group of the type Zpα1 × · · · × Zpαn . n

FINITE ABELIAN GROUPS

191

First, let us examine a slight generalization of ﬁnite abelian groups. Suppose that G is a group and let {gi } be a set of elements in G, where i is in some index set I (not necessarily ﬁnite). The smallest subgroup of G containing all of the gi ’s is the subgroup of G generated by the gi ’s. If this subgroup of G is in fact all of G, then G is generated by the set {gi : i ∈ I}. In this case the gi ’s are said to be the generators of G. If there is a ﬁnite set {gi : i ∈ I} that generates G, then G is ﬁnitely generated. Example 1. Obviously, all ﬁnite groups are ﬁnitely generated. For example, the group S3 is generated by the permutations (12) and (123). The group Z × Zn is an inﬁnite group but is ﬁnitely generated by {(1, 0), (0, 1)}. Example 2. Not all groups are ﬁnitely generated. Consider the rational numbers Q under the operation of addition. Suppose that Q is ﬁnitely generated with generators p1 /q1 , . . . , pn /qn , where each pi /qi is a fraction expressed in its lowest terms. Let p be some prime that does not divide any of the denominators q1 , . . . , qn . We claim that 1/p cannot be in the subgroup of Q that is generated by p1 /q1 , . . . , pn /qn , since p does not divide the denominator of any element in this subgroup. This fact is easy to see since the sum of any two generators is pi /qi + pj /qj = (pi qj + pj qi )/(qi qj ).

Theorem 11.1 Let H be the subgroup of a group G that is generated by {gi ∈ G : i ∈ I}. Then h ∈ H exactly when it is a product of the form
α α h = gi11 · · · ginn ,

where the gik ’s are not necessarily distinct. The product abelian, a−3 b5 a7 reason that powers of a ﬁxed gi may occur several times in the is that we may have a nonabelian group. However, if the group is then the gi ’s need occur only once. For example, a product such as could always be simpliﬁed (in this case, to a4 b5 ).

α α Proof. Let K be the set of all products of the form gi11 · · · ginn , where the gik ’s are not necessarily distinct. Certainly K is a subset of H. We need only show that K is a subgroup of G. If this is the case, then K = H, since H is the smallest subgroup containing all the gi ’s.

192

CHAPTER 11

THE STRUCTURE OF GROUPS

0 Clearly, the set K is closed under the group operation. Since gi = 1, the identity is in K. It remains to show that the inverse of an element k kn g = g1 1 · · · gin in K must also be in K. However, −k k −k kn g −1 = (g1 1 · · · gin )−1 = (g1 n · · · gin 1 ).

Now let us restrict our attention to ﬁnite abelian groups. We can express any ﬁnite abelian group as a ﬁnite direct product of cyclic groups. More speciﬁcally, letting p be prime, we deﬁne a group G to be a p-group if every element in G has as its order a power of p. For example, both Z2 × Z2 and Z4 are 2-groups, whereas Z27 is a 3-group. We shall prove that every ﬁnite abelian group is isomorphic to a direct product of cyclic p-groups. Before we state the main theorem concerning ﬁnite abelian groups, we shall consider a special case. Theorem 11.2 Every ﬁnite abelian group G is the direct product of pgroups. Proof. If |G| = 1, then the theorem is trivial. Suppose that the order of G is greater than 1, say |G| = pα1 · · · pαn , n 1 where p1 , . . . , pn are all prime, and deﬁne Gi to be the set of elements in G of order pk for some integer k. Since G is an abelian group, we are guaranteed i that Gi is a subgroup of G for i = 1, . . . , n. We must show that G = G 1 × · · · × Gn . That is, we must be able to write every g ∈ G as a unique product gp1 · · · gpn where gpi is of the order of some power of pi . Since the order of g divides the order of G, we know that |g| = pβ1 pβ2 · · · pβn n 1 2 for integers β1 , . . . , βn . Letting ai = |g|/pβi , the ai ’s are relatively prime; i hence, there exist integers b1 , . . . , bn such that a1 b1 + · · · + an bn = 1. Consequently, g = g a1 b1 +···+an bn = g a1 b1 · · · g an bn . Since g (ai bi )pi = g bi |g| = e,
βi

11.1

it follows that g ai bi must be in Gi . Let gi = g ai bi . Then g = g1 · · · gn and Gi ∩ Gj = {e} for i = j. To show uniqueness, suppose that g = g1 · · · gn = h1 · · · hn with hi ∈ Gi . Then e = (g1 · · · gn )(h1 · · · hn )−1 = g1 h−1 · · · gn h−1 . n 1 The order of gi h−1 is a power of pi ; hence, the order of g1 h−1 · · · gn h−1 is the n 1 i least common multiple of the orders of the gi h−1 . This must be 1, since the i order of the identity is 1. Therefore, |gi h−1 | = 1 or gi = hi for i = 1, . . . , n. i We shall now state the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups. Theorem 11.3 (Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups) Every ﬁnite abelian group G is isomorphic to a direct product of cyclic groups of the form Zpα1 × Zpα2 × · · · × Zpαn n
1 2

where the pi ’s are primes (not necessarily distinct). Example 3. Suppose that we wish to classify all abelian groups of order 540 = 22 · 33 · 5. The Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups tells us that we have the following six possibilities. • Z2 × Z2 × Z3 × Z3 × Z3 × Z5 ; • Z2 × Z2 × Z3 × Z9 × Z5 ; • Z2 × Z2 × Z27 × Z5 ; • Z4 × Z3 × Z3 × Z3 × Z5 ; • Z4 × Z3 × Z9 × Z5 ; • Z4 × Z27 × Z5 .

The proof of the Fundamental Theorem relies on the following lemma. Lemma 11.4 Let G be a ﬁnite abelian p-group and suppose that g ∈ G has maximal order. Then G can be written as g ×H for some subgroup H of G.

194

CHAPTER 11

THE STRUCTURE OF GROUPS

Proof. Suppose that the order of G is pn . We shall induct on n. If n = 1, then G is cyclic of order p and must be generated by g. Suppose now that the statement of the lemma holds for all integers k with 1 ≤ k < n and let m g be of maximal order in G, say |g| = pm . Then ap = e for all a ∈ G. Now choose h in G such that h ∈ g , where h has the smallest possible / order. Certainly such an h exists; otherwise, G = g and we are done. Let H= h. We claim that g ∩ H = {e}. It suﬃces to show that |H| = p. Since |hp | = |h|/p, the order of hp is smaller than the order of h and must be in g by the minimality of h; that is, hp = g r for some number r. Hence, (g r )p

and the order of g r must be less than or equal to pm−1 . Therefore, g r cannot generate g . Notice that p must occur as a factor of r, say r = ps, and hp = g r = g ps . Deﬁne a to be g −s h. Then a cannot be in g ; otherwise, h would also have to be in g . Also, ap = g −sp hp = g −r hp = h−p hp = e. We have now formed an element a with order p such that a ∈ g . Since h / was chosen to have the smallest order of all of the elements that are not in g , |H| = p. Now we will show that the order of gH in the factor group G/H must be the same as the order of g in G. If |gH| < |g| = pm , then H = (gH)p

H;

hence, g p must be in g ∩ H = {e}, which contradicts the fact that the order of g is pm . Therefore, gH must have maximal order in G/H. By the Correspondence Theorem and our induction hypothesis, G/H ∼ gH × K/H = for some subgroup K of G containing H. We claim that g ∩ K = {e}. If b ∈ g ∩ K, then bH ∈ gH ∩ K/H = {H} and b ∈ g ∩ H = {e}. It follows that G = g K implies that G ∼ g × H. = The proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups follows very quickly from Lemma 11.4. Suppose that G is a ﬁnite abelian group and let g be an element of maximal order in G. If g = G, then we are done;

otherwise, G ∼ Z|g| × H for some subgroup H contained in G by the lemma. = Since |H| < |G|, we can apply mathematical induction. We now state the more general theorem for all ﬁnitely generated abelian groups. The proof of this theorem can be found in any of the references at the end of this chapter. Theorem 11.5 (Fundamental Theorem of Finitely Generated Abelian Groups) Every ﬁnitely generated abelian group G is isomorphic to a direct product of cyclic groups of the form Zpα1 × Zpα2 × · · · × Zpαn × Z × · · · × Z, n

where the pi ’s are primes (not necessarily distinct).

11.2

Solvable Groups

A subnormal series of a group G is a ﬁnite sequence of subgroups G = Hn ⊃ Hn−1 ⊃ · · · ⊃ H1 ⊃ H0 = {e}, where Hi is a normal subgroup of Hi+1 . If each subgroup Hi is normal in G, then the series is called a normal series. The length of a subnormal or normal series is the number of proper inclusions. Example 4. Any series of subgroups of an abelian group is a normal series. Consider the following series of groups: Z ⊃ 9Z ⊃ 45Z ⊃ 180Z ⊃ {0}, Z24 ⊃ 2 ⊃ 6 ⊃ 12 ⊃ {0}.

Example 5. A subnormal series need not be a normal series. Consider the following subnormal series of the group D4 : D4 ⊃ {(1), (12)(34), (13)(24), (14)(23)} ⊃ {(1), (12)(34)} ⊃ {(1)}. The subgroup {(1), (12)(34)} is not normal in D4 ; consequently, this series is not a normal series. A subnormal (normal) series {Kj } is a reﬁnement of a subnormal (normal) series {Hi } if {Hi } ⊂ {Kj }. That is, each Hi is one of the Kj .

196

CHAPTER 11

THE STRUCTURE OF GROUPS

Example 6. The series Z ⊃ 3Z ⊃ 9Z ⊃ 45Z ⊃ 90Z ⊃ 180Z ⊃ {0} is a reﬁnement of the series Z ⊃ 9Z ⊃ 45Z ⊃ 180Z ⊃ {0}.

The correct way to study a subnormal or normal series of subgroups, {Hi } of G, is actually to study the factor groups Hi+1 /Hi . We say that two subnormal (normal) series {Hi } and {Kj } of a group G are isomorphic if there is a one-to-one correspondence between the collections of factor groups {Hi+1 /Hi } and {Kj+1 /Kj }. Example 7. The two normal series Z60 ⊃ 3 ⊃ 15 ⊃ {0} Z60 ⊃ 4 ⊃ 20 ⊃ {0} of the group Z60 are isomorphic since Z60 / 3 ∼ 20 /{0} ∼ Z3 = = 3 / 15 ∼ 4 / 20 ∼ Z5 = = 15 /{0} ∼ Z60 / 4 ∼ Z4 . = =

A subnormal series {Hi } of a group G is a composition series if all the factor groups are simple; that is, if none of the factor groups of the series contains a normal subgroup. A normal series {Hi } of G is a principal series if all the factor groups are simple. Example 8. The group Z60 has a composition series Z60 ⊃ 3 ⊃ 15 ⊃ 30 ⊃ {0} with factor groups Z60 / 3 3 / 15 15 / 30 ∼ Z3 = ∼ Z5 = ∼ Z2 =

30 /{0} ∼ Z2 . =

11.2

SOLVABLE GROUPS

197

Since Z60 is an abelian group, this series is automatically a principal series. Notice that a composition series need not be unique. The series Z60 ⊃ 2 ⊃ 4 ⊃ 20 ⊃ {0} is also a composition series. Example 9. For n ≥ 5, the series Sn ⊃ An ⊃ {(1)} is a composition series for Sn since Sn /An ∼ Z2 and An is simple. = Example 10. Not every group has a composition series or a principal series. Suppose that {0} = H0 ⊂ H1 ⊂ · · · ⊂ Hn−1 ⊂ Hn = Z is a subnormal series for the integers under addition. Then H1 must be of the form nZ for some n ∈ N. In this case H1 /H0 ∼ nZ is an inﬁnite cyclic = group with many nontrivial proper normal subgroups. Although composition series need not be unique as in the case of Z60 , it turns out that any two composition series are related. The factor groups of the two composition series for Z60 are Z2 , Z2 , Z3 , and Z5 ; that is, the two composition series are isomorphic. The Jordan-H¨lder Theorem says that o this is always the case. Theorem 11.6 (Jordan-H¨lder) Any two composition series of G are o isomorphic. Proof. We shall employ mathematical induction on the length of the composition series. If the length of a composition series is 1, then G must be a simple group. In this case any two composition series are isomorphic. Suppose now that the theorem is true for all groups having a composition series of length k, where 1 ≤ k < n. Let G = Hn ⊃ Hn−1 ⊃ · · · ⊃ H1 ⊃ H0 = {e} G = Km ⊃ Km−1 ⊃ · · · ⊃ K1 ⊃ K0 = {e} be two composition series for G. We can form two new subnormal series for G since Hi ∩ Km−1 is normal in Hi+1 ∩ Km−1 and Kj ∩ Hn−1 is normal in Kj+1 ∩ Hn−1 : G = Hn ⊃ Hn−1 ⊃ Hn−1 ∩ Km−1 ⊃ · · · ⊃ H0 ∩ Km−1 = {e} G = Km ⊃ Km−1 ⊃ Km−1 ∩ Hn−1 ⊃ · · · ⊃ K0 ∩ Hn−1 = {e}.

CHAPTER 11

THE STRUCTURE OF GROUPS

Since Hi ∩Km−1 is normal in Hi+1 ∩Km−1 , the Second Isomorphism Theorem implies that (Hi+1 ∩ Km−1 )/(Hi ∩ Km−1 ) = (Hi+1 ∩ Km−1 )/(Hi ∩ (Hi+1 ∩ Km−1 )) ∼ Hi (Hi+1 ∩ Km−1 )/Hi , = where Hi is normal in Hi (Hi+1 ∩ Km−1 ). Since {Hi } is a composition series, Hi+1 /Hi must be simple; consequently, Hi (Hi+1 ∩ Km−1 )/Hi is either Hi+1 /Hi or Hi /Hi . That is, Hi (Hi+1 ∩ Km−1 ) must be either Hi or Hi+1 . Removing any nonproper inclusions from the series Hn−1 ⊃ Hn−1 ∩ Km−1 ⊃ · · · ⊃ H0 ∩ Km−1 = {e}, we have a composition series for Hn−1 . Our induction hypothesis says that this series must be equivalent to the composition series Hn−1 ⊃ · · · ⊃ H1 ⊃ H0 = {e}. Hence, the composition series G = Hn ⊃ Hn−1 ⊃ · · · ⊃ H1 ⊃ H0 = {e} and G = Hn ⊃ Hn−1 ⊃ Hn−1 ∩ Km−1 ⊃ · · · ⊃ H0 ∩ Km−1 = {e} are equivalent. If Hn−1 = Km−1 , then the composition series {Hi } and {Kj } are equivalent and we are done; otherwise, Hn−1 Km−1 is a normal subgroup of G properly containing Hn−1 . In this case Hn−1 Km−1 = G and we can apply the Second Isomorphism Theorem once again; that is, Km−1 /(Km−1 ∩ Hn−1 ) ∼ (Hn−1 Km−1 )/Hn−1 = G/Hn−1 . = Therefore, G = Hn ⊃ Hn−1 ⊃ Hn−1 ∩ Km−1 ⊃ · · · ⊃ H0 ∩ Km−1 = {e} and G = Km ⊃ Km−1 ⊃ Km−1 ∩ Hn−1 ⊃ · · · ⊃ K0 ∩ Hn−1 = {e} are equivalent and the proof of the theorem is complete.

A group G is solvable if it has a composition series {Hi } such that all of the factor groups Hi+1 /Hi are abelian. Solvable groups will play a fundamental role when we study Galois theory and the solution of polynomial equations. Example 11. The group S4 is solvable since S4 ⊃ A4 ⊃ {(1), (12)(34), (13)(24), (14)(23)} ⊃ {(1)} has abelian factor groups; however, for n ≥ 5 the series Sn ⊃ An ⊃ {(1)} is a composition series for Sn with a nonabelian factor group. Therefore, Sn is not a solvable group for n ≥ 5.

Group Actions

Group actions generalize group multiplication. If G is a group and X is an arbitrary set, a group action of an element g ∈ G and x ∈ X is a product, gx, living in X. Many problems in algebra may best be attacked via group actions. For example, the proofs of the Sylow theorems and of Burnside’s Counting Theorem are most easily understood when they are formulated in terms of group actions.

12.1

Groups Acting on Sets

Let X be a set and G be a group. A (left) action of G on X is a map G × X → X given by (g, x) → gx, where 1. ex = x for all x ∈ X; 2. (g1 g2 )x = g1 (g2 x) for all x ∈ X and all g1 , g2 ∈ G. Under these considerations X is called a G-set. Notice that we are not requiring X to be related to G in any way. It is true that every group G acts on every set X by the trivial action (g, x) → x; however, group actions are more interesting if the set X is somehow related to the group G. Example 1. Let G = GL2 (R) and X = R2 . Then G acts on X by left multiplication. If v ∈ R2 and I is the identity matrix, then Iv = v. If A and B are 2 × 2 invertible matrices, then (AB)v = A(Bv) since matrix multiplication is associative. Example 2. Let G = D4 , the symmetry group of a square. If X = {1, 2, 3, 4} is the set of vertices of the square, then we can consider D4 to consist of the following permutations: {(1), (13), (24), (1432), (1234), (12)(34), (14)(23), (13)(24)}. 203

204

CHAPTER 12

GROUP ACTIONS

The elements of D4 act on X as functions. The permutation (13)(24) acts on vertex 1 by sending it to vertex 3, on vertex 2 by sending it to vertex 4, and so on. It is easy to see that the axioms of a group action are satisﬁed. In general, if X is any set and G is a subgroup of SX , the group of all permutations acting on X, then X is a G-set under the group action (σ, x) → σ(x) for σ ∈ G and x ∈ X. Example 3. If we let X = G, then every group G acts on itself by the left regular representation; that is, (g, x) → λg (x) = gx, where λg is left multiplication: e · x = λe x = ex = x (gh) · x = λgh x = λg λh x = λg (hx) = g · (h · x). If H is a subgroup of G, then G is an H-set under left multiplication by elements of H. Example 4. Let G be a group and suppose that X = G. If H is a subgroup of G, then G is an H-set under conjugation; that is, we can deﬁne an action of H on G, H × G → G, via (h, g) → hgh−1 for h ∈ H and g ∈ G. Clearly, the ﬁrst axiom for a group action holds. Observing that (h1 h2 , g) = h1 h2 g(h1 h2 )−1 = h1 (h2 gh−1 )h−1 2 1 = (h1 , (h2 , g)), we see that the second condition is also satisﬁed. Example 5. Let H be a subgroup of G and LH the set of left cosets of H. The set LH is a G-set under the action (g, xH) → gxH. Again, it is easy to see that the ﬁrst axiom is true. Since (gg )xH = g(g xH), the second axiom is also true.

12.1

GROUPS ACTING ON SETS

205

If G acts on a set X and x, y ∈ X, then x is said to be G-equivalent to y if there exists a g ∈ G such that gx = y. We write x ∼G y or x ∼ y if two elements are G-equivalent. Proposition 12.1 Let X be a G-set. Then G-equivalence is an equivalence relation on X. Proof. The relation ∼ is reﬂexive since ex = x. Suppose that x ∼ y for x, y ∈ X. Then there exists a g such that gx = y. In this case g −1 y = x; hence, y ∼ x. To show that the relation is transitive, suppose that x ∼ y and y ∼ z. Then there must exist group elements g and h such that gx = y and hy = z. So z = hy = (hg)x, and x is equivalent to z. If X is a G-set, then each partition of X associated with G-equivalence is called an orbit of X under G. We will denote the orbit that contains an element x of X by Ox . Example 6. Let G be the permutation group deﬁned by G = {(1), (123), (132), (45), (123)(45), (132)(45)} and X = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. Then X is a G-set. The orbits are O1 = O2 = O3 = {1, 2, 3} and O4 = O5 = {4, 5}. Now suppose that G is a group acting on a set X and let g be an element of G. The ﬁxed point set of g in X, denoted by Xg , is the set of all x ∈ X such that gx = x. We can also study the group elements g that ﬁx a given x ∈ X. This set is more than a subset of G, it is a subgroup. This subgroup is called the stabilizer subgroup or isotropy subgroup of x. We will denote the stabilizer subgroup of x by Gx . Remark. It is important to remember that Xg ⊂ X and Gx ⊂ G. Example 7. Let X = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} and suppose that G is the permutation group given by the permutations {(1), (12)(3456), (35)(46), (12)(3654)}. Then the ﬁxed point sets of X under the action of G are X(1) = X, X(35)(46) = {1, 2}, X(12)(3456) = X(12)(3654) = ∅,

206 and the stabilizer subgroups are

CHAPTER 12

GROUP ACTIONS

G1 = G2 = {(1), (35)(46)}, G3 = G4 = G5 = G6 = {(1)}. It is easily seen that Gx is a subgroup of G for each x ∈ X. Proposition 12.2 Let G be a group acting on a set X and x ∈ X. The stabilizer group, Gx , of x is a subgroup of G. Proof. Clearly, e ∈ Gx since the identity ﬁxes every element in the set X. Let g, h ∈ Gx . Then gx = x and hx = x. So (gh)x = g(hx) = gx = x; hence, the product of two elements in Gx is also in Gx . Finally, if g ∈ Gx , then x = ex = (g −1 g)x = (g −1 )gx = g −1 x. So g −1 is in Gx . We will denote the number of elements in the ﬁxed point set of an element g ∈ G by |Xg | and denote the number of elements in the orbit of x of x ∈ X by |Ox |. The next theorem demonstrates the relationship between orbits of an element x ∈ X and the left cosets of Gx in G. Theorem 12.3 Let G be a ﬁnite group and X a ﬁnite G-set. If x ∈ X, then |Ox | = [G : Gx ]. Proof. We know that |G|/|Gx | is the number of left cosets of Gx in G by Lagrange’s Theorem. We will deﬁne a bijective map φ between the orbit Ox of X and the set of left cosets LGx of Gx in G. Let y ∈ Ox . Then there exists a g in G such that gx = y. Deﬁne φ by φ(y) = gGx . First we must show that this map is well-deﬁned and does not depend on our selection of g. Suppose that h is another element in G such that hx = y. Then gx = hx or x = g −1 hx; hence, g −1 h is in the stabilizer subgroup of x. Therefore, h ∈ gGx or gGx = hGx . Thus, y gets mapped to the same coset regardless of the choice of the representative from that coset. To show that φ is one-to-one, assume that φ(x1 ) = φ(x2 ). Then there exist g1 , g2 ∈ G such that x1 = g1 x and x2 = g2 x. Since there exists a g ∈ Gx such that g2 = g1 g, x2 = g2 x = g1 gx = g1 x = x1 ; consequently, the map φ is one-to-one. Finally, we must show that the map φ is onto. Let gGx be a left coset. If gx = y, then φ(y) = gGx .

THE CLASS EQUATION

12.2

The Class Equation

Let X be a ﬁnite G-set and XG be the set of ﬁxed points in X; that is, XG = {x ∈ X : gx = x for all g ∈ G}. Since the orbits of the action partition X,
n

|X| = |XG | +
i=k

|Oxi |,

where xk , . . . , xn are representatives from the distinct nontrivial orbits of X. Now consider the special case in which G acts on itself by conjugation, (g, x) → gxg −1 . The center of G, Z(G) = {x : xg = gx for all g ∈ G}, is the set of points that are ﬁxed by conjugation. The nontrivial orbits of the action are called the conjugacy classes of G. If x1 , . . . , xk are representatives from each of the nontrivial conjugacy classes of G and |Ox1 | = n1 , . . . , |Oxk | = nk , then |G| = |Z(G)| + n1 + · · · + nk . The stabilizer subgroups of each of the xi ’s, C(xi ) = {g ∈ G : gxi = xi g}, are called the centralizer subgroups of the xi ’s. From Theorem 12.3, we obtain the class equation: |G| = |Z(G)| + [G : C(x1 )] + · · · + [G : C(xk )]. One of the consequences of the class equation is that the order of each conjugacy class must divide the order of |G|. Example 8. It is easy to check that the conjugacy classes in S3 are the following: {(1)}, {(123), (132)}, {(12), (13), (23)}. The class equation is 6 = 1 + 2 + 3. Example 9. The conjugacy classes for D4 are {(1)}, {(13), (24)}, {(1432), (1234)}, {(12)(34), (14)(23), (13)(24)}. The class equation is 8 = 1 + 2 + 2 + 3.

208

CHAPTER 12

GROUP ACTIONS

Example 10. For Sn it takes a bit of work to ﬁnd the conjugacy classes. We begin with cycles. Suppose that σ = (a1 , . . . , ak ) is a cycle and let τ ∈ Sn . By Theorem 5.9, τ στ −1 = (τ (a1 ), . . . , τ (ak )). Consequently, any two cycles of the same length are conjugate. Now let σ = σ1 σ2 · · · σr be a cycle decomposition, where the length of each cycle σi is ri . Then σ is conjugate to every other τ ∈ Sn whose cycle decomposition has the same lengths. The number of conjugate classes in Sn is the number of ways in which n can be partitioned into sums of positive integers. For example, we can partition the integer 3 into the following three sums: 3 = 1+1+1 3 = 1+2 3 = 3; therefore, there are three conjugacy classes. The problem of ﬁnding the number of such partitions for any positive integer n is what computer scientists call NP-complete. This eﬀectively means that the problem cannot be solved for a large n because the computations would be too time-consuming for even the largest computer. Theorem 12.4 Let G be a group of order pn where p is prime. Then G has a nontrivial center. Proof. We apply the class equation |G| = |Z(G)| + n1 + · · · + nk . Since each ni > 1 and ni | G, p must divide each ni . Also, p | |G|; hence, p must divide |Z(G)|. Since the identity is always in the center of G, |Z(G)| ≥ 1. Therefore, |Z(G)| ≥ p and there exists some g ∈ Z(G) such that g = 1. Corollary 12.5 Let G be a group of order p2 where p is prime. Then G is abelian. Proof. By Theorem 12.4, |Z(G)| = p or p2 . If |Z(G)| = p2 , then we are done. Suppose that |Z(G)| = p. Then Z(G) and G/Z(G) both have order p and must both be cyclic groups. Choosing a generator aZ(G) for

BURNSIDE’S COUNTING THEOREM

209

G/Z(G), we can write any element gZ(G) in the quotient group as am Z(G) for some integer m; hence, g = am x for some x in the center of G. Similarly, if hZ(G) ∈ G/Z(G), there exists a y in Z(G) such that h = an y for some integer n. Since x and y are in the center of G, they commute with all other elements of G; therefore, gh = am xan y = am+n xy = an yam x = hg, and G must be abelian.

Burnside’s Counting Theorem

Suppose that we are to color the vertices of a square with two diﬀerent colors, say black and white. We might suspect that there would be 24 = 16 diﬀerent colorings. However, some of these colorings are equivalent. If we color the ﬁrst vertex black and the remaining vertices white, it is the same as coloring the second vertex black and the remaining ones white since we could obtain the second coloring simply by rotating the square 90◦ (Figure 12.1).

The proof of Burnside’s Counting Theorem depends on the following lemma.

210

CHAPTER 12

GROUP ACTIONS

Lemma 12.6 Let X be a G-set and suppose that x ∼ y. Then Gx is isomorphic to Gy . In particular, |Gx | = |Gy |. Proof. Let G act on X by (g, x) → g · x. Since x ∼ y, there exists a g ∈ G such that g · x = y. Let a ∈ Gx . Since gag −1 · y = ga · g −1 y = ga · x = g · x = y, we can deﬁne a map φ : Gx → Gy by φ(a) = gag −1 . The map φ is a homomorphism since φ(ab) = gabg −1 = gag −1 gbg −1 = φ(a)φ(a). Suppose that φ(a) = φ(b). Then gag −1 = gbg −1 or a = b; hence, the map is injective. To show that φ is onto, let b be in Gy ; then g −1 bg is in Gx since g −1 bg · x = g −1 b · gx = g −1 b · y = g −1 · y = x; and φ(g −1 bg) = b. Theorem 12.7 (Burnside) Let G be a ﬁnite group acting on a set X and let k denote the number of orbits of X. Then k= 1 |G| |Xg |.
g∈G

Proof. We look at all the ﬁxed points x of all the elements in g ∈ G; that is, we look at all g’s and all x’s such that gx = x. If viewed in terms of ﬁxed point sets, the number of all g’s ﬁxing x’s is |Xg |.

Example 11. Let X = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and suppose that G is the permutation group G = {(1), (13), (13)(25), (25)}. The orbits of X are {1, 3}, {2, 5}, and {4}. The ﬁxed point sets are X(1) = X X(13) = {2, 4, 5} X(13)(25) = {4} X(25) = {1, 3, 4}. Burnside’s Theorem says that k= 1 |G| 1 |Xg | = (5 + 3 + 1 + 3) = 3. 4

A Geometric Example
Before we apply Burnside’s Theorem to switching-theory problems, let us examine the number of ways in which the vertices of a square can be colored black or white. Notice that we can sometimes obtain equivalent colorings by simply applying a rigid motion to the square. For instance, as we have pointed out, if we color one of the vertices black and the remaining three white, it does not matter which vertex was colored black since a rotation will give an equivalent coloring. The symmetry group of a square, D4 , is given by the following permutations: (1) (13) (24) (1432) (1234) (12)(34) (14)(23) (13)(24) The group G acts on the set of vertices {1, 2, 3, 4} in the usual manner. We can describe the diﬀerent colorings by mappings from X into Y = {B, W } where B and W represent the colors black and white, respectively. Each map f : X → Y describes a way to color the corners of the square. Every σ ∈ D4

induces a permutation σ of the possible colorings given by σ(f ) = f ◦ σ for f : X → Y . For example, suppose that f is deﬁned by f (1) = B f (2) = W f (3) = W f (4) = W and σ = (12)(34). Then σ(f ) = f ◦ σ sends vertex 2 to B and the remaining vertices to W . The set of all such σ is a permutation group G on the set of possible colorings. Let X denote the set of all possible colorings; that is, X is the set of all possible maps from X to Y . Now we must compute the number of G-equivalence classes. 1. X(1) = X since the identity ﬁxes every possible coloring. |X| = 24 = 16. 2. X(1234) consists of all f ∈ X such that f is unchanged by the permutation (1234). In this case f (1) = f (2) = f (3) = f (4), so that all values of f must be the same; that is, either f (x) = B or f (x) = W for every vertex x of the square. So |X(1234) | = 2. 3. |X(1432) | = 2. 4. For X(13)(24) , f (1) = f (3) and f (2) = f (4). Thus, |X(13)(24) | = 22 = 4. 5. |X(12)(34) | = 4. 6. |X(14)(23) | = 4. 7. For X(13) , f (1) = f (3) and the other corners can be of any color; hence, |X(13) | = 23 = 8. 8. |X(24) | = 8. By Burnside’s Theorem, we can conclude that there are exactly 1 4 (2 + 21 + 22 + 21 + 22 + 22 + 23 + 23 ) = 6 8 ways to color the vertices of the square.

12.3

BURNSIDE’S COUNTING THEOREM

213

Proposition 12.8 Let G be a permutation group of X and X the set of functions from X to Y . Then there exists a permutation group G acting on X, where σ ∈ G is deﬁned by σ(f ) = f ◦ σ for σ ∈ G and f ∈ X. Furthermore, if n is the number of cycles in the cycle decomposition of σ, then |Xσ | = |Y |n . Proof. Let σ ∈ G and f ∈ X. Clearly, f ◦ σ is also in X. Suppose that g is another function from X to Y such that σ(f ) = σ(g). Then for each x ∈ X, f (σ(x)) = σ(f )(x) = σ(g)(x) = g(σ(x)). Since σ is a permutation of X, every element x in X is the image of some x in X under σ; hence, f and g agree on all elements of X. Therefore, f = g and σ is injective. The map σ → σ is onto, since the two sets are the same size. Suppose that σ is a permutation of X with cycle decomposition σ = σ1 σ2 · · · σn . Any f in Xσ must have the same value on each cycle of σ. Since there are n cycles and |Y | possible values for each cycle, |Xσ | = |Y |n . Example 12. Let X = {1, 2, . . . , 7} and suppose that Y = {A, B, C}. If g is the permutation of X given by (13)(245) = (13)(245)(6)(7), then n = 4. Any f ∈ Fg must have the same value on each cycle in g. There are |Y | = 3 such choices for any value, so |Fg | = 34 = 81. Example 13. Suppose that we wish to color the vertices of a square using four diﬀerent colors. By Proposition 12.8, we can immediately decide that there are 1 4 (4 + 41 + 42 + 41 + 42 + 42 + 43 + 43 ) = 55 8 possible ways. x1 E x2 E . . . xn E

Switching Functions
In switching theory we are concerned with the design of electronic circuits with binary inputs and outputs. The simplest of these circuits is a switching function that has n inputs and a single output (Figure 12.2). Large electronic circuits can often be constructed by combining smaller modules of this kind. The inherent problem here is that even for a simple circuit a large number of diﬀerent switching functions can be constructed. With only four inputs and a single output, we can construct 65, 536 diﬀerent switching functions. However, we can often replace one switching function with another merely by permuting the input leads to the circuit (Figure 12.3). a E f b E

Figure 12.3. A switching function of two variables We deﬁne a switching or Boolean function of n variables to be a function from Zn to Z2 . Since any switching function can have two possible 2 n values for each binary n-tuple and there are 2n binary n-tuples, 22 switching functions are possible for n variables. In general, allowing permutations of the inputs greatly reduces the number of diﬀerent kinds of modules that are needed to build a large circuit. The possible switching functions with two input variables a and b are listed in Table 12.1. Two switching functions f and g are equivalent if g can be obtained from f by a permutation of the input variables. For example, g(a, b, c) = f (b, c, a). In this case g ∼ f via the permutation (acb). In the case of switching functions of two variables, the permutation (ab) reduces 16 possible switching functions to 12 equivalent functions since f2 f3 f10 f11 ∼ ∼ ∼ ∼ f4 f5 f12 f13 .

For three input variables there are 22 = 256 possible switching func4 tions; in the case of four variables there are 22 = 65,536. The number of equivalence classes is too large to reasonably calculate directly. It is necessary to employ Burnside’s Theorem.

Consider a switching function with three possible inputs, a, b, and c. As we have mentioned, two switching functions f and g are equivalent if a permutation of the input variables of f gives g. It is important to notice that a permutation of the switching functions is not simply a permutation of the input values {a, b, c}. A switching function is a set of output values for the inputs a, b, and c, so when we consider equivalent switching functions, we are permuting 23 possible outputs, not just three input values. For example, each binary triple (a, b, c) has a speciﬁc output associated with it. The permutation (acb) changes outputs as follows: (0, 0, 0) → (0, 0, 0) (0, 0, 1) → (0, 1, 0) (0, 1, 0) → (1, 0, 0) . . . (1, 1, 0) → (1, 0, 1) (1, 1, 1) → (1, 1, 1). Let X be the set of output values for a switching function in n variables. Then |X| = 2n . We can enumerate these values as follows: (0, . . . , 0, 1) → 0 (0, . . . , 1, 0) → 1 (0, . . . , 1, 1) → 2 . . . (1, . . . , 1, 1) → 2n − 1.

Now let us consider a circuit with four input variables and a single output. Suppose that we can permute the leads of any circuit according to the following permutation group: (a) (ac) (bd) (adcb) (abcd) (ab)(cd) (ad)(bc) (ac)(bd). The permutations of the four possible input variables induce the permutations of the output values in Table 12.2. Hence, there are 1 16 (2 + 2 · 212 + 2 · 26 + 3 · 210 ) = 9616 8 possible switching functions of four variables under this group of permutations. This number will be even smaller if we consider the full symmetric group on four letters. Historical Note
William Burnside was born in London in 1852. He attended Cambridge University from 1871 to 1875 and won the Smith’s Prize in his last year. After his graduation he lectured at Cambridge. He was made a member of the Royal Society in 1893. Burnside wrote approximately 150 papers on topics in applied mathematics, diﬀerential geometry, and probability, but his most famous contributions were in group theory. Several of Burnside’s conjectures have stimulated research to this day. One such conjecture was that every group of odd order is solvable; that is, for a group G of odd order, there exists a sequence of subgroups G = Hn ⊃ Hn−1 ⊃ · · · ⊃ H1 ⊃ H0 = {e}

such that Hi is normal in Hi+1 and Hi+1 /Hi is abelian. This conjecture was ﬁnally proven by W. Feit and J. Thompson in 1963. Burnside’s The Theory of Groups of Finite Order, published in 1897, was one of the ﬁrst books to treat groups in a modern context as opposed to permutation groups. The second edition, published in 1911, is still a classic.

The Sylow Theorems

We already know that the converse of Lagrange’s Theorem is false. If G is a group of order m and n divides m, then G does not necessarily possess a subgroup of order n. For example, A4 has order 12 but does not possess a subgroup of order 6. However, the Sylow Theorems do provide a partial converse for Lagrange’s Theorem: in certain cases they guarantee us subgroups of speciﬁc orders. These theorems yield a powerful set of tools for the classiﬁcation of all ﬁnite nonabelian groups.

13.1

The Sylow Theorems

We will use the idea of group actions to prove the Sylow Theorems. Recall for a moment what it means for G to act on itself by conjugation and how conjugacy classes are distributed in the group according to the class equation, discussed in Chapter 12. A group G acts on itself by conjugation via the map (g, x) → gxg −1 . Let x1 , . . . , xk be representatives from each of the distinct conjugacy classes of G that consist of more than one element. Then the class equation can be written as |G| = |Z(G)| + [G : C(x1 )] + · · · + [G : C(xk )], where Z(G) = {g ∈ G : gx = xg for all x ∈ G} is the center of G and C(xi ) = {g ∈ G : gxi = xi g} is the centralizer subgroup of xi . We now begin our investigation of the Sylow Theorems by examining subgroups of order p, where p is prime. A group G is a p-group if every element in G has as its order a power of p, where p is a prime number. A subgroup of a group G is a p-subgroup if it is a p-group. Theorem 13.1 (Cauchy) Let G be a ﬁnite group and p a prime such that p divides the order of G. Then G contains a subgroup of order p. 220

13.1

THE SYLOW THEOREMS

221

Proof. We will use induction on the order of G. If |G| = p, then clearly G must have an element of order p. Now assume that every group of order k, where p ≤ k < n and p divides k, has an element of order p. Assume that |G| = n and p | n and consider the class equation of G: |G| = |Z(G)| + [G : C(x1 )] + · · · + [G : C(xk )]. We have two cases. Case 1. The order of one of the centralizer subgroups, C(xi ), is divisible by p for some i, i = 1, . . . , k. In this case, by our induction hypothesis, we are done. Since C(xi ) is a proper subgroup of G and p divides |C(xi )|, C(xi ) must contain an element of order p. Hence, G must contain an element of order p. Case 2. The order of no centralizer subgroup is divisible by p. Then p divides [G : C(xi )], the order of each conjugacy class in the class equation; hence, p must divide the center of G, Z(G). Since Z(G) is abelian, it must have a subgroup of order p by the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups. Therefore, the center of G contains an element of order p. Corollary 13.2 Let G be a ﬁnite group. Then G is a p-group if and only if |G| = pn . Example 1. Let us consider the group A5 . We know that |A5 | = 60 = 22 · 3 · 5. By Cauchy’s Theorem, we are guaranteed that A5 has subgroups of orders 2, 3 and 5. The Sylow Theorems give us even more information about the possible subgroups of A5 . We are now ready to state and prove the ﬁrst of the Sylow Theorems. The proof is very similar to the proof of Cauchy’s Theorem. Theorem 13.3 (First Sylow Theorem) Let G be a ﬁnite group and p a prime such that pr divides |G|. Then G contains a subgroup of order pr . Proof. We induct on the order of G once again. If |G| = p, then we are done. Now suppose that the order of G is n with n > p and that the theorem is true for all groups of order less than n. We shall apply the class equation once again: |G| = |Z(G)| + [G : C(x1 )] + · · · + [G : C(xk )]. First suppose that p does not divide [G : C(xi )] for some i. Then | |C(xi )|, since pr divides |G| = |C(xi )| · [G : C(xi )]. Now we can apply the induction hypothesis to C(xi ). pr

CHAPTER 13

THE SYLOW THEOREMS

Hence, we may assume that p divides [G : C(xi )] for all i. Since p divides |G|, the class equation says that p must divide |Z(G)|; hence, by Cauchy’s Theorem, Z(G) has an element of order p, say g. Let N be the group generated by g. Clearly, N is a normal subgroup of Z(G) since Z(G) is abelian; therefore, N is normal in G since every element in Z(G) commutes with every element in G. Now consider the factor group G/N of order |G|/p. By the induction hypothesis, G/N contains a subgroup H of order pr−1 . The inverse image of H under the canonical homomorphism φ : G → G/N is a subgroup of order pr in G. A Sylow p-subgroup P of a group G is a maximal p-subgroup of G. To prove the other two Sylow Theorems, we need to consider conjugate subgroups as opposed to conjugate elements in a group. For a group G, let S be the collection of all subgroups of G. For any subgroup H, S is a H-set, where H acts on S by conjugation. That is, we have an action H ×S →S deﬁned by h · K → hKh−1 for K in S. The set N (H) = {g ∈ G : gHg −1 = H} is a subgroup of G. Notice that H is a normal subgroup of N (H). In fact, N (H) is the largest subgroup of G in which H is normal. We call N (H) the normalizer of H in G. Lemma 13.4 Let P be a Sylow p-subgroup of a ﬁnite group G and let x have as its order a power of p. If x−1 P x = P . Then x ∈ P . Proof. Certainly x ∈ N (P ), and the cyclic subgroup, xP ⊂ N (P )/P , has as its order a power of p. By the Correspondence Theorem there exists a subgroup H of N (P ) such that H/P = xP . Since |H| = |P | · | xP |, the order of H must be a power of p. However, P is a Sylow p-subgroup contained in H. Since the order of P is the largest power of p dividing |G|, H = P . Therefore, H/P is the trivial subgroup and xP = P , or x ∈ P . Lemma 13.5 Let H and K be subgroups of G. The number of distinct H-conjugates of K is [H : N (K) ∩ H].

13.1

Proof. We deﬁne a bijection between the conjugacy classes of K and the right cosets of N (K) ∩ H by h−1 Kh → (N (K) ∩ H)h. To show that this map is a bijection, let h1 , h2 ∈ H and suppose that (N (K) ∩ H)h1 = (N (K) ∩ H)h2 . Then h2 h−1 ∈ N (K). Therefore, K = h2 h−1 Kh1 h−1 or 1 1 2 h−1 Kh1 = h−1 Kh2 , and the map is an injection. It is easy to see that this 1 2 map is surjective; hence, we have a one-to-one and onto map between the H-conjugates of K and the right cosets of N (K) ∩ H in H. Theorem 13.6 (Second Sylow Theorem) Let G be a ﬁnite group and p a prime dividing |G|. Then all Sylow p-subgroups of G are conjugate. That is, if P1 and P2 are two Sylow p-subgroups, there exists a g ∈ G such that gP1 g −1 = P2 . Proof. Let P be a Sylow p-subgroup of G and suppose that |G| = pr m and |P | = pr . Let P = {P = P1 , P2 , . . . , Pk } consist of the distinct conjugates of P in G. By Lemma 13.5, k = [G : N (P )]. Notice that |G| = pr m = |N (P )| · [G : N (P )] = |N (P )| · k. Since pr divides |N (P )|, p cannot divide k. Given any other Sylow psubgroup Q, we must show that Q ∈ P. Consider the Q-conjugacy classes of each Pi . Clearly, these conjugacy classes partition P. The size of the partition containing Pi is [Q : N (Pi ) ∩ Q]. Lagrange’s Theorem tells us that this number is a divisor of |Q| = pr . Hence, the number of conjugates in every equivalence class of the partition is a power of p. However, since p does not divide k, one of these equivalence classes must contain only a single Sylow p-subgroup, say Pj . Therefore, for some Pj , x−1 Pj x = Pj for all x ∈ Q. By Lemma 13.4, Pj = Q. Theorem 13.7 (Third Sylow Theorem) Let G be a ﬁnite group and let p be a prime dividing the order of G. Then the number of Sylow p-subgroups is congruent to 1 (mod p) and divides |G|. Proof. Let P be a Sylow p-subgroup acting on the set of Sylow p-subgroups, P = {P = P1 , P2 , . . . , Pk }, by conjugation. From the proof of the Second Sylow Theorem, the only P -conjugate of P is itself and the order of the other P -conjugacy classes is a

224

CHAPTER 13

THE SYLOW THEOREMS

power of p. Each P -conjugacy class contributes a positive power of p toward |P| except the equivalence class {P }. Since |P| is the sum of positive powers of p and 1, |P| ≡ 1 (mod p). Now suppose that G acts on P by conjugation. Since all Sylow psubgroups are conjugate, there can be only one orbit under this action. For P ∈ P, |P| = |orbit of P| = [G : N (P )]. But [G : N (P )] is a divisor of |G|; consequently, the number of Sylow p-subgroups of a ﬁnite group must divide the order of the group. Historical Note
Peter Ludvig Mejdell Sylow was born in 1832 in Christiania, Norway (now Oslo). After attending Christiania University, Sylow taught high school. In 1862 he obtained a temporary appointment at Christiania University. Even though his appointment was relatively brief, he inﬂuenced students such as Sophus Lie (1842– 1899). Sylow had a chance at a permanent chair in 1869, but failed to obtain the appointment. In 1872, he published a 10-page paper presenting the theorems that now bear his name. Later Lie and Sylow collaborated on a new edition of Abel’s works. In 1898, a chair at Christiania University was ﬁnally created for Sylow through the eﬀorts of his student and colleague Lie. Sylow died in 1918.

13.2

Examples and Applications

Example 2. Using the Sylow Theorems, we can determine that A5 has subgroups of orders 2, 3, 4, and 5. The Sylow p-subgroups of A5 have orders 3, 4, and 5. The Third Sylow Theorem tells us exactly how many Sylow p-subgroups A5 has. Since the number of Sylow 5-subgroups must divide 60 and also be congruent to 1 (mod 5), there are either one or six Sylow 5-subgroups in A5 . All Sylow 5-subgroups are conjugate. If there were only a single Sylow 5-subgroup, it would be conjugate to itself; that is, it would be a normal subgroup of A5 . Since A5 has no normal subgroups, this is impossible; hence, we have determined that there are exactly six distinct Sylow 5-subgroups of A5 . The Sylow Theorems allow us to prove many useful results about ﬁnite groups. By using them, we can often conclude a great deal about groups of a particular order if certain hypotheses are satisﬁed. Theorem 13.8 If p and q are distinct primes with p < q, then every group G of order pq has a single subgroup of order q and this subgroup is normal

in G. Hence, G cannot be simple. Furthermore, if q ≡ 1 (mod p), then G is cyclic. Proof. We know that G contains a subgroup H of order q. The number of conjugates of H divides pq and is equal to 1 + kq for k = 0, 1, . . .. However, 1 + q is already too large to divide the order of the group; hence, H can only be conjugate to itself. That is, H must be normal in G. The group G also has a Sylow p-subgroup, say K. The number of conjugates of K must divide q and be equal to 1 + kp for k = 0, 1, . . .. Since q is prime, either 1 + kp = q or 1 + kp = 1. If 1 + kp = 1, then K is normal in G. In this case, we can easily show that G satisﬁes the criteria, given in Chapter 8, for the internal direct product of H and K. Since H is isomorphic to Zq and K is isomorphic to Zp , G ∼ Zp × Zq ∼ Zpq by Theorem 8.10. = = Example 3. Every group of order 15 is cyclic. This is true because 15 = 5·3 and 5 ≡ 1 (mod 3). Example 4. Let us classify all of the groups of order 99 = 32 · 11 up to isomorphism. First we will show that every group G of order 99 is abelian. By the Third Sylow Theorem, there are 1 + 3k Sylow 3-subgroups, each of order 9, for some k = 0, 1, 2, . . .. Also, 1 + 3k must divide 11; hence, there can only be a single normal Sylow 3-subgroup H in G. Similarly, there are 1 + 11k Sylow 11-subgroups and 1 + 11k must divide 9. Consequently, there is only one Sylow 11-subgroup K in G. By Corollary 12.5, any group of order p2 is abelian for p prime; hence, H is isomorphic either to Z3 × Z3 or to Z9 . Since K has order 11, it must be isomorphic to Z11 . Therefore, the only possible groups of order 99 are Z3 × Z3 × Z11 or Z9 × Z11 up to isomorphism. To determine all of the groups of order 5 · 7 · 47 = 1645, we need the following theorem. Theorem 13.9 Let G = aba−1 b−1 : a, b ∈ G be the subgroup consisting of all ﬁnite products of elements of the form aba−1 b−1 in a group G. Then G is a normal subgroup of G and G/G is abelian. The subgroup G of G is called the commutator subgroup of G. We leave the proof of this theorem as an exercise. Example 5. We will now show that every group of order 5 · 7 · 47 = 1645 is abelian, and cyclic by Corollary 8.11. By the Third Sylow Theorem, G has only one subgroup H1 of order 47. So G/H1 has order 35 and must

226

CHAPTER 13

THE SYLOW THEOREMS

be abelian by Theorem 13.8. Hence, the commutator subgroup of G is contained in H which tells us that |G | is either 1 or 47. If |G | = 1, we are done. Suppose that |G | = 47. The Third Sylow Theorem tells us that G has only one subgroup of order 5 and one subgroup of order 7. So there exist normal subgroups H2 and H3 in G, where |H2 | = 5 and |H3 | = 7. In either case the quotient group is abelian; hence, G must be a subgroup of Hi , i = 1, 2. Therefore, the order of G is 1, 5, or 7. However, we already have determined that |G | = 1 or 47. So the commutator subgroup of G is trivial, and consequently G is abelian.

Finite Simple Groups
Given a ﬁnite group, one can ask whether or not that group has any normal subgroups. Recall that a simple group is one with no proper nontrivial normal subgroups. As in the case of A5 , proving a group to be simple can be a very diﬃcult task; however, the Sylow Theorems are useful tools for proving that a group is not simple. Usually some sort of counting argument is involved. Example 6. Let us show that no group G of order 20 can be simple. By the Third Sylow Theorem, G contains one or more Sylow 5-subgroups. The number of such subgroups is congruent to 1 (mod 5) and must also divide 20. The only possible such number is 1. Since there is only a single Sylow 5-subgroup and all Sylow 5-subgroups are conjugate, this subgroup must be normal. Example 7. Let G be a ﬁnite group of order pn , n > 1 and p prime. By Theorem 12.4, G has a nontrivial center. Since the center of any group G is a normal subgroup, G cannot be a simple group. Therefore, groups of orders 4, 8, 9, 16, 25, 27, 32, 49, 64, and 81 are not simple. In fact, the groups of order 4, 9, 25, and 49 are abelian by Theorem 12.5. Example 8. No group of order 56 = 23 · 7 is simple. We have seen that if we can show that there is only one Sylow p-subgroup for some prime p dividing 56, then this must be a normal subgroup and we are done. By the Third Sylow Theorem, there are either one or eight Sylow 7-subgroups. If there is only a single Sylow 7-subgroup, then it must be normal. On the other hand, suppose that there are eight Sylow 7-subgroups. Then each of these subgroups must be cyclic; hence, the intersection of any two of these subgroups contains only the identity of the group. This leaves 8 · 6 = 48 distinct elements in the group, each of order 7. Now let us count Sylow 2-subgroups. There are either one or seven Sylow 2-subgroups. Any

element of a Sylow 2-subgroup other than the identity must have as its order a power of 2; and therefore cannot be one of the 48 elements of order 7 in the Sylow 7-subgroups. Since a Sylow 2-subgroup has order 8, there is only enough room for a single Sylow 2-subgroup in a group of order 56. If there is only one Sylow 2-subgroup, it must be normal. For other groups G it is more diﬃcult to prove that G is not simple. Suppose G has order 48. In this case the technique that we employed in the last example will not work. We need the following lemma to prove that no group of order 48 is simple. Lemma 13.10 Let H and K be ﬁnite subgroups of a group G. Then |HK| = Proof. Recall that HK = {hk : h ∈ H, k ∈ K}. Certainly, |HK| ≤ |H| · |K| since some element in HK could be written as the product of diﬀerent elements in H and K. It is quite possible that h1 k1 = h2 k2 for h1 , h2 ∈ H and k1 , k2 ∈ K. If this is the case, let a = (h1 )−1 h2 = k1 (k2 )−1 . Notice that a ∈ H ∩ K, since (h1 )−1 h2 is in H and k2 (k1 )−1 is in K; consequently, h2 = h1 a−1 k2 = ak1 . Conversely, let h = h1 b−1 and k = bk1 for b ∈ H ∩ K. Then hk = h1 k1 , where h ∈ H and k ∈ K. Hence, any element hk ∈ HK can be written in the form hi ki for hi ∈ H and ki ∈ K, as many times as there are elements in H ∩ K; that is, |H ∩ K| times. Therefore, |HK| = (|H| · |K|)/|H ∩ K|. Example 9. To demonstrate that a group G of order 48 is not simple, we will show that G contains either a normal subgroup of order 8 or a normal subgroup of order 16. By the Third Sylow Theorem, G has either one or three Sylow 2-subgroups of order 16. If there is only one subgroup, then it must be a normal subgroup. |H| · |K| . |H ∩ K|

THE SYLOW THEOREMS

Suppose that the other case is true, and two of the three Sylow 2subgroups are H and K. We claim that |H ∩ K| = 8. If |H ∩ K| ≤ 4, then by Lemma 13.10, 16 · 16 |HK| = = 64, 4 which is impossible. So H ∩ K is normal in both H and K since it has index 2. The normalizer of H ∩ K contains both H and K, and |H ∩ K| must both be a multiple of 16 greater than 1 and divide 48. The only possibility is that |N (H ∩ K)| = 48. Hence, N (H ∩ K) = G. The following famous conjecture of Burnside was proved in a long and diﬃcult paper by Feit and Thompson [2]. Theorem 13.11 (Odd Order Theorem) Every ﬁnite simple group of nonprime order must be of even order. The proof of this theorem laid the groundwork for a program in the 1960s and 1970s that classiﬁed all ﬁnite simple groups. The success of this program is one of the outstanding achievements of modern mathematics.

The main objective of ﬁnite group theory is to classify all possible ﬁnite groups up to isomorphism. This problem is very diﬃcult even if we try to classify the groups of order less than or equal to 60. However, we can break the problem down into several intermediate problems. 1. Find all simple groups G ( |G| ≤ 60). Do not use the Odd Order Theorem unless you are prepared to prove it. 2. Find the number of distinct groups G, where the order of G is n for n = 1, . . . , 60. 3. Find the actual groups (up to isomorphism) for each n. This is a challenging project that requires a working knowledge of the group theory you have learned up to this point. Even if you do not complete it, it will teach you a great deal about ﬁnite groups. You can use Table 13.1 as a guide.

Rings

Up to this point we have studied sets with a single binary operation satisfying certain axioms, but often we are more interested in working with sets that have two binary operations. For example, one of the most natural algebraic structures to study is the integers with the operations of addition and multiplication. These operations are related to one another by the distributive property. If we consider a set with two such related binary operations satisfying certain axioms, we have an algebraic structure called a ring. In a ring we add and multiply such elements as real numbers, complex numbers, matrices, and functions.

14.1

Rings

A nonempty set R is a ring if it has two closed binary operations, addition and multiplication, satisfying the following conditions. 1. a + b = b + a for a, b ∈ R. 2. (a + b) + c = a + (b + c) for a, b, c ∈ R. 3. There is an element 0 in R such that a + 0 = a for all a ∈ R. 4. For every element a ∈ R, there exists an element −a in R such that a + (−a) = 0. 5. (ab)c = a(bc) for a, b, c ∈ R. 6. For a, b, c ∈ R, a(b + c) = ab + ac (a + b)c = ac + bc. 232

14.1

RINGS

233

This last condition, the distributive axiom, relates the binary operations of addition and multiplication. Notice that the ﬁrst four axioms simply require that a ring be an abelian group under addition, so we could also have deﬁned a ring to be an abelian group (R, +) together with a second binary operation satisfying the ﬁfth and sixth conditions given above. If there is an element 1 ∈ R such that 1 = 0 and 1a = a1 = a for each element a ∈ R, we say that R is a ring with unity or identity . A ring R for which ab = ba for all a, b in R is called a commutative ring. A commutative ring R with identity is called an integral domain if, for every a, b ∈ R such that ab = 0, either a = 0 or b = 0. A division ring is a ring R, with an identity, in which every nonzero element in R is a unit; that is, for each a ∈ R with a = 0, there exists a unique element a−1 such that a−1 a = aa−1 = 1. A commutative division ring is called a ﬁeld. The relationship among rings, integral domains, division rings, and ﬁelds is shown in Figure 14.1.

Figure 14.1. Types of rings Example 1. As we have mentioned previously, the integers form a ring. In fact, Z is an integral domain. Certainly if ab = 0 for two integers a and b, either a = 0 or b = 0. However, Z is not a ﬁeld. There is no integer that is the multiplicative inverse of 2, since 1/2 is not an integer. The only integers with multiplicative inverses are 1 and −1. Example 2. Under the ordinary operations of addition and multiplication, all of the familiar number systems are rings: the rationals, Q; the real numbers, R; and the complex numbers, C. Each of these rings is a ﬁeld.

CHAPTER 14

RINGS

Example 3. We can deﬁne the product of two elements a and b in Zn by ab (mod n). For instance, in Z12 , 5 · 7 ≡ 11 (mod 12). This product makes the abelian group Zn into a ring. Certainly Zn is a commutative ring; however, it may fail to be an integral domain. If we consider 3 · 4 ≡ 0 (mod 12) in Z12 , it is easy to see that a product of two nonzero elements in the ring can be equal to zero. A nonzero element a in a ring R is called a zero divisor if there is a nonzero element b in R such that ab = 0. In the previous example, 3 and 4 are zero divisors in Z12 . Example 4. In calculus the continuous real-valued functions on an interval [a, b] form a commutative ring. We add or multiply two functions by adding or multiplying the values of the functions. If f (x) = x2 and g(x) = cos x, then (f +g)(x) = f (x)+g(x) = x2 +cos x and (f g)(x) = f (x)g(x) = x2 cos x. Example 5. The 2 × 2 matrices with entries in R form a ring under the usual operations of matrix addition and multiplication. This ring is noncommutative, since it is usually the case that AB = BA. Also, notice that we can have AB = 0 when neither A nor B is zero. Example 6. For an example of a noncommutative division ring, let 1= 1 0 0 1 0 i i 0 i= 0 1 −1 0 i 0 0 −i ,

matrices of the form α β −β α ,

where α = a + di and β = b + ci are complex numbers. We can deﬁne addition and multiplication on H either by the usual matrix operations or in terms of the generators 1, i, j, and k: (a1 + b1 i + c1 j + d1 k) + (a2 + b2 i + c2 j + d2 k) = (a1 + a2 ) + (b1 + b2 )i + (c1 + c2 )j + (d1 + d2 )k and (a1 + b1 i + c1 j + d1 k)(a2 + b2 i + c2 j + d2 k) = α + βi + γj + δk, where α = a1 a2 − b1 b2 − c1 c2 − d1 d2 β = a1 b2 + a1 b1 + c1 d2 − d1 c2 γ = a1 c2 − b1 d2 + c1 a2 − d1 b2 δ = a1 d2 + b1 c2 − c1 b2 − d1 a2 . Though multiplication looks complicated, it is actually a straightforward computation if we remember that we just add and multiply elements in H like polynomials and keep in mind the relationships between the generators i, j, and k. The ring H is called the ring of quaternions. To show that the quaternions are a division ring, we must be able to ﬁnd an inverse for each nonzero element. Notice that (a + bi + cj + dk)(a − bi − cj − dk) = a2 + b2 + c2 + d2 . This element can be zero only if a, b, c, and d are all zero. So if a + bi + cj + dk = 0, a − bi − cj − dk (a + bi + cj + dk) = 1. a2 + b2 + c2 + d2

Proposition 14.1 Let R be a ring with a, b ∈ R. Then 1. a0 = 0a = 0; 2. a(−b) = (−a)b = −ab;

236 3. (−a)(−b) = ab. Proof. To prove (1), observe that a0 = a(0 + 0) = a0 + a0;

CHAPTER 14

RINGS

hence, a0 = 0. Similarly, 0a = 0. For (2), we have ab + a(−b) = a(b − b) = a0 = 0; consequently, −ab = a(−b). Similarly, −ab = (−a)b. Part (3) follows directly from (2) since (−a)(−b) = −(a(−b)) = −(−ab) = ab. Just as we have subgroups of groups, we have an analogous class of substructures for rings. A subring S of a ring R is a subset S of R such that S is also a ring under the inherited operations from R. Example 7. The ring nZ is a subring of Z. Notice that even though the original ring may have an identity, we do not require that its subring have an identity. We have the following chain of subrings: Z ⊂ Q ⊂ R ⊂ C.

The following proposition gives us some easy criteria for determining whether or not a subset of a ring is indeed a subring. (We will leave the proof of this proposition as an exercise.) Proposition 14.2 Let R be a ring and S a subset of R. Then S is a subring of R if and only if the following conditions are satisﬁed. 1. S = ∅. 2. rs ∈ S for all r, s ∈ S. 3. r − s ∈ S for all r, s ∈ S. Example 8. Let R = M2 (R) be the ring of 2 × 2 matrices with entries in R. If T is the set of upper triangular matrices in R, i.e., T = then T is a subring of R. If A= a b 0 c and B = a 0 b c a b 0 c : a, b, c ∈ R ,

Integral Domains and Fields

Let us brieﬂy recall some deﬁnitions. If R is a ring and r is a nonzero element in R, then r is said to be a zero divisor if there is some nonzero element s ∈ R such that rs = 0. A commutative ring with identity is said to be an integral domain if it has no zero divisors. If an element a in a ring R with identity has a multiplicative inverse, we say that a is a unit. If every nonzero element in a ring R is a unit, then R is called a division ring. A commutative division ring is called a ﬁeld. Example 9. If i2 = −1, then the set Z[i] = {m + ni : m, n ∈ Z} forms a ring known as the Gaussian integers. It is easily seen that the Gaussian integers are a subring of the complex numbers since they are closed under addition and multiplication. Let α = a+bi be a unit in Z[i]. Then α = a−bi is also a unit since if αβ = 1, then αβ = 1. If β = c + di, then 1 = αβαβ = (a2 + b2 )(c2 + d2 ). Therefore, a2 + b2 must either be 1 or −1; or, equivalently, a + bi = ±1 or a + bi = ±i. Therefore, units of this ring are ±1 and ±i; hence, the Gaussian integers are not a ﬁeld. We will leave it as an exercise to prove that the Gaussian integers are an integral domain. Example 10. The set of matrices F = 1 0 0 1 , 1 1 1 0 , 0 1 1 1 , 0 0 0 0

with entries in Z2 forms a ﬁeld. √ √ Example 11. The √ Q( 2 ) = {a + b 2 : a, b ∈ Q} is a ﬁeld. The inverse set √ of an element a + b 2 in Q( 2 ) is a −b √ + 2 2. a2 − 2b2 a − 2b2

We have the following alternative characterization of integral domains.

CHAPTER 14

Proposition 14.3 (Cancellation Law) Let D be a commutative ring with identity. Then D is an integral domain if and only if for all nonzero elements a ∈ D with ab = ac, we have b = c. Proof. Let D be an integral domain. Then D has no zero divisors. Let ab = ac with a = 0. Then a(b − c) = 0. Hence, b − c = 0 and b = c. Conversely, let us suppose that cancellation is possible in D. That is, suppose that ab = ac implies b = c. Let ab = 0. If a = 0, then ab = a0 or b = 0. Therefore, a cannot be a zero divisor. The following surprising theorem is due to Wedderburn. Theorem 14.4 Every ﬁnite integral domain is a ﬁeld. Proof. Let D be a ﬁnite integral domain and D∗ be the set of nonzero elements of D. We must show that every element in D∗ has an inverse. For each a ∈ D∗ we can deﬁne a map λa : D∗ → D∗ by λa (d) = ad. This map makes sense, because if a = 0 and d = 0, then ad = 0. The map λa is one-to-one, since for d1 , d2 ∈ D∗ , ad1 = λa (d1 ) = λa (d2 ) = ad2 implies d1 = d2 by left cancellation. Since D∗ is a ﬁnite set, the map λa must also be onto; hence, for some d ∈ D∗ , λa (d) = ad = 1. Therefore, a has a left inverse. Since D is commutative, d must also be a right inverse for a. Consequently, D is a ﬁeld. For any nonnegative integer n and any element r in a ring R we write r + · · · + r (n times) as nr. We deﬁne the characteristic of a ring R to be the least positive integer n such that nr = 0 for all r ∈ R. If no such integer exists, then the characteristic of R is deﬁned to be 0. Example 12. For every prime p, Zp is a ﬁeld of characteristic p. By Proposition 2.1, every nonzero element in Zp has an inverse; hence, Zp is a ﬁeld. If a is any nonzero element in the ﬁeld, then pa = 0, since the order of any nonzero element in the abelian group Zp is p. Theorem 14.5 The characteristic of an integral domain is either prime or zero. Proof. Let D be an integral domain and suppose that the characteristic of D is n with n = 0. If n is not prime, then n = ab, where 1 < a < n and

14.3

RING HOMOMORPHISMS AND IDEALS

239

1 < b < n. Since 0 = n1 = (ab)1 = (a1)(b1) and there are no zero divisors in D, either a1 = 0 or b1 = 0. Hence, the characteristic of D must be less than n, which is a contradiction. Therefore, n must be prime.

14.3

Ring Homomorphisms and Ideals

In the study of groups, a homomorphism is a map that preserves the operation of the group. Similarly, a homomorphism between rings preserves the operations of addition and multiplication in the ring. More speciﬁcally, if R and S are rings, then a ring homomorphism is a map φ : R → S satisfying φ(a + b) = φ(a) + φ(b) φ(ab) = φ(a)φ(b) for all a, b ∈ R. If φ : R → S is a one-to-one and onto homomorphism, then φ is called an isomorphism of rings. The set of elements that a ring homomorphism maps to 0 plays a fundamental role in the theory of rings. For any ring homomorphism φ : R → S, we deﬁne the kernel of a ring homomorphism to be the set ker φ = {r ∈ R : φ(r) = 0}. Example 13. For any integer n we can deﬁne a ring homomorphism φ : Z → Zn by a → a (mod n). This is indeed a ring homomorphism, since φ(a + b) = (a + b) = a (mod n)

(mod n) + b (mod n)

= φ(a) + φ(b) and φ(ab) = ab (mod n) = a (mod n) · b (mod n) = φ(a)φ(b). The kernel of the homomorphism φ is nZ. Example 14. Let C[a, b] be the ring of continuous real-valued functions on an interval [a, b] as in Example 4. For a ﬁxed α ∈ [a, b], we can deﬁne

240

CHAPTER 14

RINGS

a ring homomorphism φα : C[a, b] → R by φα (f ) = f (α). This is a ring homomorphism since φα (f + g) = (f + g)(α) = f (α) + g(α) = φα (f ) + φα (g) φα (f g) = (f g)(α) = f (α)g(α) = φα (f )φα (g). Ring homomorphisms of the type φα are called evaluation homomorphisms. In the next proposition we will examine some fundamental properties of ring homomorphisms. The proof of the proposition is left as an exercise. Proposition 14.6 Let φ : R → S be a ring homomorphism. 1. If R is a commutative ring, then φ(R) is a commutative ring. 2. φ(0) = 0. 3. Let 1R and 1S be the identities for R and S, respectively. If φ is onto, then φ(1R ) = 1S . 4. If R is a ﬁeld and φ(R) = 0, then φ(R) is a ﬁeld. In group theory we found that normal subgroups play a special role. These subgroups have nice characteristics that make them more interesting to study than arbitrary subgroups. In ring theory the objects corresponding to normal subgroups are a special class of subrings called ideals. An ideal in a ring R is a subring I of R such that if a is in I and r is in R, then both ar and ra are in I; that is, rI ⊂ I and Ir ⊂ I for all r ∈ R. Example 15. Every ring R has at least two ideals, {0} and R. These ideals are called the trivial ideals. Let R be a ring with identity and suppose that I is an ideal in R such that 1 is in R. Since for any r ∈ R, r1 = r ∈ I by the deﬁnition of an ideal, I = R. Example 16. If a is any element in a commutative ring R with identity, then the set a = {ar : r ∈ R} is an ideal in R. Certainly, a is nonempty since both 0 = a0 and a = a1 are in a . The sum of two elements in a is again in a since ar+ar = a(r+r ). The inverse of ar is −ar = a(−r) ∈ a . Finally, if we multiply an element

14.3

RING HOMOMORPHISMS AND IDEALS

241

ar ∈ a by an arbitrary element s ∈ R, we have s(ar) = a(sr). Therefore, a satisﬁes the deﬁnition of an ideal. If R is a commutative ring with identity, then an ideal of the form a = {ar : r ∈ R} is called a principal ideal. Theorem 14.7 Every ideal in the ring of integers Z is a principal ideal. Proof. The zero ideal {0} is a principal ideal since 0 = {0}. If I is any nonzero ideal in Z, then I must contain some positive integer m. There exists at least one such positive integer n in I by the Principle of WellOrdering. Now let a be any element in I. Using the division algorithm, we know that there exist integers q and r such that a = nq + r where 0 ≤ r < n. This equation tells us that r = a − nq ∈ I, but r must be 0 since n is the least positive element in I. Therefore, a = nq and I = n . Example 17. The set nZ is ideal in the ring of integers. If na is in nZ and b is in Z, then nab is in nZ as required. In fact, by Theorem 14.7, these are the only ideals of Z. Proposition 14.8 The kernel of any ring homomorphism φ : R → S is an ideal in R. Proof. We know from group theory that ker φ is an additive subgroup of R. Suppose that r ∈ R and a ∈ ker φ. Then we must show that ar and ra are in ker φ. However, φ(ar) = φ(a)φ(r) = 0φ(r) = 0 and φ(ra) = φ(r)φ(a) = φ(r)0 = 0.

Remark. In our deﬁnition of an ideal we have required that rI ⊂ I and Ir ⊂ I for all r ∈ R. Such ideals are sometimes referred to as two-sided ideals. We can also consider one-sided ideals; that is, we may require only that either rI ⊂ I or Ir ⊂ I for r ∈ R hold but not both. Such ideals are called left ideals and right ideals, respectively. Of course, in a commutative ring any ideal must be two-sided. In this text we will concentrate on two-sided ideals.

Theorem 14.9 Let I be an ideal of R. The factor group R/I is a ring with multiplication deﬁned by (r + I)(s + I) = rs + I. Proof. We already know that R/I is an abelian group under addition. Let r + I and s + I be in R/I. We must show that the product (r + I)(s + I) = rs+I is independent of the choice of coset; that is, if r ∈ r +I and s ∈ s+I, then r s must be in rs + I. Since r ∈ r + I, there exists an element a in I such that r = r + a. Similarly, there exists a b ∈ I such that s = s + b. Notice that r s = (r + a)(s + b) = rs + as + rb + ab and as + rb + ab ∈ I since I is an ideal; consequently, r s ∈ rs + I. We will leave as an exercise the veriﬁcation of the associative law for multiplication and the distributive laws. The ring R/I in Theorem 14.9 is called the factor or quotient ring. Just as with group homomorphisms and normal subgroups, there is a relationship between ring homomorphisms and ideals. Theorem 14.10 Let I be an ideal of R. The map ψ : R → R/I deﬁned by ψ(r) = r + I is a ring homomorphism of R onto R/I with kernel I. Proof. Certainly ψ : R → R/I is a surjective abelian group homomorphism. It remains to show that ψ works correctly under ring multiplication. Let r and s be in R. Then ψ(r)ψ(s) = (r + I)(s + I) = rs + I = ψ(rs), which completes the proof of the theorem. The map ψ : R → R/I is often called the natural or canonical homomorphism. In ring theory we have isomorphism theorems relating ideals and ring homomorphisms similar to the isomorphism theorems for groups that relate normal subgroups and homomorphisms in Chapter 9. We will prove only the First Isomorphism Theorem for rings in this chapter and leave the proofs of the other two theorems as exercises. All of the proofs are similar to the proofs of the isomorphism theorems for groups. Theorem 14.11 (First Isomorphism Theorem) Let φ : R → S be a ring homomorphism. Then ker φ is an ideal of R. If ψ : R → R/ ker φ is the canonical homomorphism, then there exists a unique isomorphism η : R/ ker φ → φ(R) such that φ = ηψ.

Proof. Let K = ker φ. By the First Isomorphism Theorem for groups, there exists a well-deﬁned group homomorphism η : R/K → ψ(R) deﬁned by η(r+K) = ψ(r) for the additive abelian groups R and R/K. To show that this is a ring homomorphism, we need only show that η((r + K)(s + K)) = η(r + K)η(s + K); but η((r + K)(s + K)) = η(rs + K) = ψ(rs) = ψ(r)ψ(s) = η(r + K)η(s + K).

Theorem 14.12 (Second Isomorphism Theorem) Let I be a subring of a ring R and J an ideal of R. Then I ∩ J is an ideal of I and I/I ∩ J ∼ (I + J)/J. = Theorem 14.13 (Third Isomorphism Theorem) Let R be a ring and I and J be ideals of R where J ⊂ I. Then R/J . R/I ∼ = I/J Theorem 14.14 (Correspondence Theorem) Let I be a ideal of a ring R. Then S → S/I is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of subrings S containing I and the set of subrings of R/I. Furthermore, the ideals of R containing I correspond to ideals of R/I.

Maximal and Prime Ideals

In this particular section we are especially interested in certain ideals of commutative rings. These ideals give us special types of factor rings. More speciﬁcally, we would like to characterize those ideals I of a commutative ring R such that R/I is an integral domain or a ﬁeld. A proper ideal M of a ring R is a maximal ideal of R if the ideal M is not a proper subset of any ideal of R except R itself. That is, M is a maximal ideal if for any ideal I properly containing M , I = R. The following theorem completely characterizes maximal ideals for commutative rings with identity in terms of their corresponding factor rings.

244

CHAPTER 14

RINGS

Theorem 14.15 Let R be a commutative ring with identity and M an ideal in R. Then M is a maximal ideal of R if and only if R/M is a ﬁeld. Proof. Let M be a maximal ideal in R. If R is a commutative ring, then R/M must also be a commutative ring. Clearly, 1 + M acts as an identity for R/M . We must also show that every nonzero element in R/M has an inverse. If a + M is a nonzero element in R/M , then a ∈ M . Deﬁne I to be / the set {ra + m : r ∈ R and m ∈ M }. We will show that I is an ideal in R. The set I is nonempty since 0a + 0 = 0 is in I. If r1 a + m1 and r2 a + m2 are two elements in I, then (r1 a + m1 ) − (r2 a + m2 ) = (r1 − r2 )a + (m1 − m2 ) is in I. Also, for any r ∈ R it is true that rI ⊂ I; hence, I is closed under multiplication and satisﬁes the necessary conditions to be an ideal. Therefore, by Proposition 14.2 and the deﬁnition of an ideal, I is an ideal properly containing M . Since M is a maximal ideal, I = R; consequently, by the deﬁnition of I there must be an m in M and a b in R such that 1 = ab + m. Therefore, 1 + M = ab + M = ba + M = (a + M )(b + M ). Conversely, suppose that M is an ideal and R/M is a ﬁeld. Since R/M is a ﬁeld, it must contain at least two elements: 0 + M = M and 1 + M . Hence, M is a proper ideal of R. Let I be any ideal properly containing M . We need to show that I = R. Choose a in I but not in M . Since a + M is a nonzero element in a ﬁeld, there exists an element b + M in R/M such that (a + M )(b + M ) = ab + M = 1 + M . Consequently, there exists an element m ∈ M such that ab + m = 1 and 1 is in I. Therefore, r1 = r ∈ I for all r ∈ R. Consequently, I = R. Example 18. Let pZ be an ideal in Z, where p is prime. Then pZ is a maximal ideal since Z/pZ ∼ Zp is a ﬁeld. = An ideal P in a commutative ring R is called a prime ideal if whenever ab ∈ P , then either a ∈ P or b ∈ P . Example 19. It is easy to check that the set P = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10} is an ideal in Z12 . This ideal is prime. In fact, it is a maximal ideal. Proposition 14.16 Let R be a commutative ring with identity. Then P is a prime ideal in R if and only if R/P is an integral domain.

14.4

MAXIMAL AND PRIME IDEALS

245

Proof. First let us assume that P is an ideal in R and R/P is an integral domain. Suppose that ab ∈ P . If a + P and b + P are two elements of R/P such that (a + P )(b + P ) = 0 + P = P , then either a + P = P or b + P = P . This means that either a is in P or b is in P , which shows that P must be prime. Conversely, suppose that P is prime and (a + P )(b + P ) = ab + P = 0 + P = P. Then ab ∈ P . If a ∈ P , then b must be in P by the deﬁnition of a prime / ideal; hence, b + P = 0 + P and R/P is an integral domain. Example 20. Every ideal in Z is of the form nZ. The factor ring Z/nZ ∼ Zn = is an integral domain only when n is prime. It is actually a ﬁeld. Hence, the nonzero prime ideals in Z are the ideals pZ, where p is prime. This example really justiﬁes the use of the word “prime” in our deﬁnition of prime ideals.

Since every ﬁeld is an integral domain, we have the following corollary. Corollary 14.17 Every maximal ideal in a commutative ring with identity is also a prime ideal.

Historical Note
Amalie Emmy Noether, one of the outstanding mathematicians of this century, was born in Erlangen, Germany in 1882. She was the daughter of Max Noether (1844– 1921), a distinguished mathematician at the University of Erlangen. Together with Paul Gordon (1837–1912), Emmy Noether’s father strongly inﬂuenced her early education. She entered the University of Erlangen at the age of 18. Although women had been admitted to universities in England, France, and Italy for decades, there was great resistance to their presence at universities in Germany. Noether was one of only two women among the university’s 986 students. After completing her doctorate under Gordon in 1907, she continued to do research at Erlangen, occasionally lecturing when her father was ill. Noether went to G¨ttingen to study in 1916. David Hilbert and Felix Klein o tried unsuccessfully to secure her an appointment at G¨ttingen. Some of the faculty o objected to women lecturers, saying, “What will our soldiers think when they return to the university and are expected to learn at the feet of a woman?” Hilbert, annoyed at the question, responded, “Meine Herren, I do not see that the sex of a candidate is an argument against her admission as a Privatdozent. After all,

the Senate is not a bathhouse.” At the end of World War I, attitudes changed and conditions greatly improved for women. After Noether passed her habilitation examination in 1919, she was given a title and was paid a small sum for her lectures. In 1922, Noether became a Privatdozent at G¨ttingen. Over the next 11 years o she used axiomatic methods to develop an abstract theory of rings and ideals. Though she was not good at lecturing, Noether was an inspiring teacher. One of her many students was B. L. van der Waerden, author of the ﬁrst text treating abstract algebra from a modern point of view. Some of the other mathematicians Noether inﬂuenced or closely worked with were Alexandroﬀ, Artin, Brauer, Courant, Hasse, Hopf, Pontryagin, von Neumann, and Weyl. One of the high points of her career was an invitation to address the International Congress of Mathematicians in Zurich in 1932. In spite of all the recognition she received from her colleagues, Noether’s abilities were never recognized as they should have been during her lifetime. She was never promoted to full professor by the Prussian academic bureaucracy. In 1933, Noether, a Jew, was banned from participation in all academic activities in Germany. She emigrated to the United States, took a position at Bryn Mawr College, and became a member of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton. Noether died suddenly on April 14, 1935. After her death she was eulogized by such notable scientists as Albert Einstein.

An Application to Software Design

The Chinese Remainder Theorem is a result from elementary number theory about the solution of systems of simultaneous congruences. The Chinese mathematician Sun-ts¨ wrote about the theorem in the ﬁrst century A.D. ı This theorem has some interesting consequences in the design of software for parallel processors. Lemma 14.18 Let m and n be positive integers such that gcd(m, n) = 1. Then for a, b ∈ Z the system x ≡ a (mod m) x ≡ b (mod n) has a solution. If x1 and x2 are two solutions of the system, then x1 ≡ x2 (mod mn). Proof. The equation x ≡ a (mod m) has a solution since a + km satisﬁes the equation for all k ∈ Z. We must show that there exists an integer k1 such that a + k1 m ≡ b (mod n).

14.5

AN APPLICATION TO SOFTWARE DESIGN

247

This is equivalent to showing that k1 m ≡ (b − a) (mod n)

has a solution for k1 . Since m and n are relatively prime, there exist integers s and t such that ms + nt = 1. Consequently, (b − a)ms = (b − a) − (b − a)nt, or [(b − a)s]m ≡ (b − a) (mod n). Now let k1 = (b − a)s. To show that any two solutions are congruent modulo mn, let c1 and c2 be two solutions of the system. That is, ci ≡ a for i = 1, 2. Then c2 ≡ c1 c2 ≡ c1 (mod m) (mod n). (mod m) ci ≡ b (mod n)

Therefore, both m and n divide c1 − c2 . Consequently, c2 ≡ c1 (mod mn). Example 21. Let us solve the system x ≡ 3 x ≡ 4 (mod 4) (mod 5).

Using the Euclidean algorithm, we can ﬁnd integers s and t such that 4s + 5t = 1. Two such integers are s = −1 and t = 1. Consequently, x = a + k1 m = 3 + 4k1 = 3 + 4[(5 − 4)4] = 19.

Theorem 14.19 (Chinese Remainder Theorem) Let n1 , n2 , . . . , nk be positive integers such that gcd(ni , nj ) = 1 for i = j. Then for any integers a1 , . . . , ak , the system x ≡ a1 x ≡ a2 . . . x ≡ ak (mod n1 ) (mod n2 )

(mod nk )

has a solution. Furthermore, any two solutions of the system are congruent modulo n1 n2 · · · nk . Proof. We will use mathematical induction on the number of equations in the system. If there are k = 2 equations, then the theorem is true by Lemma 14.18. Now suppose that the result is true for a system of k equations or less and that we wish to ﬁnd a solution of x ≡ a1 x ≡ a2 . . . x ≡ ak+1 (mod n1 ) (mod n2 )

(mod nk+1 ).

Considering the ﬁrst k equations, there exists a solution that is unique modulo n1 · · · nk , say a. Since n1 · · · nk and nk+1 are relatively prime, the system x ≡ a (mod n1 · · · nk ) (mod nk+1 )

x ≡ ak+1

has a solution that is unique modulo n1 . . . nk+1 by the lemma. Example 22. Let us solve the system x ≡ 3 x ≡ 4 x ≡ 1 x ≡ 5 (mod 4) (mod 5) (mod 9) (mod 7).

From Example 21 we know that 19 is a solution of the ﬁrst two congruences and any other solution of the system is congruent to 19 (mod 20). Hence, we can reduce the system to a system of three congruences: x ≡ 19 x ≡ 1 x ≡ 5 (mod 20) (mod 9) (mod 7).

Solving the next two equations, we can reduce the system to x ≡ 19 x ≡ 5 (mod 180) (mod 7).

14.5

AN APPLICATION TO SOFTWARE DESIGN

249

Solving this last system, we ﬁnd that 19 is a solution for the system that is unique up to modulo 1260. One interesting application of the Chinese Remainder Theorem in the design of computer software is that the theorem allows us to break up a calculation involving large integers into several less formidable calculations. Most computers will handle integer calculations only up to a certain size. For example, the largest integer available on many workstations is 231 − 1 = 2,147,483,647. Special software is required for calculations involving larger integers which cannot be added directly by the machine. However, by using the Chinese Remainder Theorem we can break down large integer additions and multiplications into calculations that the computer can handle directly. This is especially useful on parallel processing computers which have the ability to run several programs concurrently. Most computers have a single central processing unit (CPU), which can only add two numbers at a time. To add a list of ten numbers, the CPU must do nine additions in sequence. However, a parallel processing computer has more than one CPU. A computer with 10 CPUs, for example, can perform 10 diﬀerent additions at the same time. If we can take a large integer and break it down into parts, sending each part to a diﬀerent CPU, then by performing several additions or multiplications simultaneously on those parts, we can work with an integer that the computer would not be able to handle as a whole. Example 23. Suppose that we wish to multiply 2134 by 1531. We will use the integers 95, 97, 98, and 99 because they are relatively prime. We can break down each integer into four parts: 2134 ≡ 44 2134 ≡ 0 2134 ≡ 76 2134 ≡ 55 and 1531 ≡ 11 1531 ≡ 76 1531 ≡ 61 1531 ≡ 46 (mod 95) (mod 97) (mod 98) (mod 99). (mod 95) (mod 97) (mod 98) (mod 99)

250

CHAPTER 14

RINGS

Multiplying the corresponding equations, we obtain 2134 · 1531 2134 · 1531 2134 · 1531 2134 · 1531 ≡ 44 · 11 ≡ 0 · 76 ≡ 76 · 61 ≡ 55 · 46 ≡ ≡ ≡ ≡ 9 (mod 95) 0 (mod 97) 30 (mod 98) 55 (mod 99).

Each of these four computations can be sent to a diﬀerent processor if our computer has several CPUs. By the above calculation, we know that 2134 · 1531 is a solution of the system x ≡ 9 x ≡ 0 x ≡ 30 x ≡ 55 (mod 95) (mod 97) (mod 98) (mod 99).

The Chinese Remainder Theorem tells us that solutions are unique up to modulo 95 · 97 · 98 · 99 = 89,403,930. Solving this system of congruences for x tells us that 2134 · 1531 = 3,267,154. The conversion of the computation into the four subcomputations will take some computing time. In addition, solving the system of congruences can also take considerable time. However, if we have many computations to be performed on a particular set of numbers, it makes sense to transform the problem as we have done above and to perform the necessary calculations simultaneously.

Polynomials

Most people are fairly familiar with polynomials by the time they begin to study abstract algebra. When we examine polynomial expressions such as p(x) = x3 − 3x + 2 q(x) = 3x2 − 6x + 5, we have a pretty good idea of what p(x) + q(x) and p(x)q(x) mean. We just add and multiply polynomials as functions; that is, (p + q)(x) = p(x) + q(x) = (x3 − 3x + 2) + (3x2 − 6x + 5) = x3 + 3x2 − 9x + 7 and (pq)(x) = p(x)q(x) = (x3 − 3x + 2)(3x2 − 6x + 5) = 3x5 − 6x4 − 4x3 + 24x2 − 27x + 10. It is probably no surprise that polynomials form a ring. In this chapter we shall emphasize the algebraic structure of polynomials by studying polynomial rings. We can prove many results for polynomial rings that are similar to the theorems we proved for the integers. Analogs of prime numbers, of the division algorithm, and of the Euclidean algorithm exist for polynomials. 256

Polynomial Rings

Throughout this chapter we shall assume that R is a commutative ring with identity. Any expression of the form
n

f (x) =
i=0

ai xi = a0 + a1 x + a2 x2 + · · · + an xn ,

where ai ∈ R and an = 0, is called a polynomial over R with indeterminate x. The elements a0 , a1 , . . . , an are called the coeﬃcients of f . The coeﬃcient an is called the leading coeﬃcient. A polynomial is called monic if the leading coeﬃcient is 1. If n is the largest nonnegative number for which an = 0, we say that the degree of f is n and write deg f (x) = n. If no such n exists—that is, if f = 0 is the zero polynomial—then the degree of f is deﬁned to be −∞. We will denote the set of all polynomials with coeﬃcients in a ring R by R[x]. Two polynomials are equal exactly when their corresponding coeﬃcients are equal; that is, if we let p(x) = a0 + a1 x + · · · + an xn q(x) = b0 + b1 x + · · · + bm xm , then p(x) = q(x) if and only if ai = bi for all i ≥ 0. To show that the set of all polynomials forms a ring, we must ﬁrst deﬁne addition and multiplication. We deﬁne the sum of two polynomials as follows. Let p(x) = a0 + a1 x + · · · + an xn q(x) = b0 + b1 x + · · · + bm xm . Then the sum of p(x) and q(x) is p(x) + q(x) = c0 + c1 x + · · · + ck xk , where ci = ai + bi for each i. We deﬁne the product of p(x) and q(x) to be p(x)q(x) = c0 + c1 x + · · · + cm+n xm+n , where ci =
k=0 i

ak bi−k = a0 bi + a1 bi−1 + · · · + ai−1 b1 + ai b0

for each i. Notice that in each case some of the coeﬃcients may be zero.

258 Example 1. Suppose that

CHAPTER 15

POLYNOMIALS

p(x) = 3 + 0x + 0x2 + 2x3 + 0x4 and q(x) = 2 + 0x − x2 + 0x3 + 4x4 are polynomials in Z[x]. If the coeﬃcient of some term in a polynomial is zero, then we usually just omit that term. In this case we would write p(x) = 3 + 2x3 and q(x) = 2 − x2 + 4x4 . The sum of these two polynomials is p(x) + q(x) = 5 − x2 + 2x3 + 4x4 . The product, p(x)q(x) = (3 + 2x3 )(2 − x2 + 4x4 ) = 6 − 3x2 + 4x3 + 12x4 − 2x5 + 8x7 , can be calculated either by determining the ci ’s in the deﬁnition or by simply multiplying polynomials in the same way as we have always done. Example 2. Let p(x) = 3 + 3x3 and q(x) = 4 + 4x2 + 4x4 be polynomials in Z12 [x]. The sum of p(x) and q(x) is 7 + 4x2 + 3x3 + 4x4 . The product of the two polynomials is the zero polynomial. This example tells us that R[x] cannot be an integral domain if R is not an integral domain.

Theorem 15.1 Let R be a commutative ring with identity. Then R[x] is a commutative ring with identity. Proof. Our ﬁrst task is to show that R[x] is an abelian group under polynomial addition. The zero polynomial, f (x) = 0, is the additive identity. Given a polynomial p(x) = n ai xi , the inverse of p(x) is easily veriﬁed to i=0 be −p(x) = n (−ai )xi = − n ai xi . Commutativity and associativity i=0 i=0 follow immediately from the deﬁnition of polynomial addition and from the fact that addition in R is both commutative and associative.

Proposition 15.2 Let p(x) and q(x) be polynomials in R[x], where R is an integral domain. Then deg p(x) + deg q(x) = deg(p(x)q(x)). Furthermore, R[x] is an integral domain.

CHAPTER 15

POLYNOMIALS

Proof. Suppose that we have two nonzero polynomials p(x) = am xm + · · · + a1 x + a0 and q(x) = bn xn + · · · + b1 x + b0 with am = 0 and bn = 0. The degrees of p and q are m and n, respectively. The leading term of p(x)q(x) is am bn xm+n , which cannot be zero since R is an integral domain; hence, the degree of p(x)q(x) is m+n, and p(x)q(x) = 0. Since p(x) = 0 and q(x) = 0 imply that p(x)q(x) = 0, we know that R[x] must also be an integral domain. We also want to consider polynomials in two or more variables, such as x2 − 3xy + 2y 3 . Let R be a ring and suppose that we are given two indeterminates x and y. Certainly we can form the ring (R[x])[y]. It is straightforward but perhaps tedious to show that (R[x])[y] ∼ R([y])[x]. We = shall identify these two rings by this isomorphism and simply write R[x, y]. The ring R[x, y] is called the ring of polynomials in two indeterminates x and y with coeﬃcients in R. We can deﬁne the ring of polynomials in n indeterminates with coeﬃcients in R similarly. We shall denote this ring by R[x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ]. Theorem 15.3 Let R be a commutative ring with identity and α ∈ R. Then we have a ring homomorphism φα : R[x] → R deﬁned by φα (p(x)) = p(α) = an αn + · · · + a1 α + a0 , where p(x) = an xn + · · · + a1 x + a0 . Proof. Let p(x) = n ai xi and q(x) = m bi xi . It is easy to show i=0 i=0 that φα (p(x) + q(x)) = φα (p(x)) + φα (q(x)). To show that multiplication is preserved under the map φα , observe that φα (p(x))φα (q(x)) = p(α)q(α)

THE DIVISION ALGORITHM

15.2

The Division Algorithm

Recall that the division algorithm for integers (Theorem 1.3) says that if a and b are integers with b > 0, then there exist unique integers q and r such that a = bq + r, where 0 ≤ r < b. The algorithm by which q and r are found is just long division. A similar theorem exists for polynomials. The division algorithm for polynomials has several important consequences. Since its proof is very similar to the corresponding proof for integers, it is worthwhile to review Theorem 1.3 at this point. Theorem 15.4 (Division Algorithm) Let f (x) and g(x) be two nonzero polynomials in F [x], where F is a ﬁeld and g(x) is a nonconstant polynomial. Then there exist unique polynomials q(x), r(x) ∈ F [x] such that f (x) = g(x)q(x) + r(x), where either deg r(x) < deg g(x) or r(x) is the zero polynomial. Proof. We will ﬁrst consider the existence of q(x) and r(x). Let S = {f (x) − g(x)h(x) : h(x) ∈ F [x]} and assume that g(x) = a0 + a1 x + · · · + an xn is a polynomial of degree n. This set is nonempty since f (x) ∈ S. If f (x) is the zero polynomial, then 0 = f (x) = 0 · g(x) + 0; hence, both q and r must also be the zero polynomial. Now suppose that the zero polynomial is not in S. In this case the degree of every polynomial in S is nonnegative. Choose a polynomial r(x) of smallest degree in S; hence, there must exist a q(x) ∈ F [x] such that r(x) = f (x) − g(x)q(x), or f (x) = g(x)q(x) + r(x). We need to show that the degree of r(x) is less than the degree of g(x). Assume that deg g(x) ≤ deg r(x). Say r(x) = b0 + b1 x + · · · + bm xm and

262 m ≥ n. Then

CHAPTER 15

POLYNOMIALS

f (x) − g(x)[q(x) − (bm /an )xm−n ] = f (x) − g(x)q(x) + (bm /an )xm−n g(x) = r(x) + (bm /an )xm−n g(x) = r(x) + bm xm + terms of lower degree is in S. This is a polynomial of lower degree than r(x), which contradicts the fact that r(x) is a polynomial of smallest degree in S; hence, deg r(x) < deg g(x). To show that q(x) and r(x) are unique, suppose that there exist two other polynomials q (x) and r (x) such that f (x) = g(x)q (x) + r (x) and deg r (x) < deg g(x) or r (x) = 0, so that f (x) = g(x)q(x) + r(x) = g(x)q (x) + r (x), and g(x)[q(x) − q (x)] = r (x) − r(x). If g is not the zero polynomial, then deg(g(x)[q(x) − q (x)]) = deg(r (x) − r(x)) ≥ deg g(x). However, the degrees of both r(x) and r (x) are strictly less than the degree of g(x); therefore, r(x) = r (x) and q(x) = q (x). Example 3. The division algorithm merely formalizes long division of polynomials, a task we have been familiar with since high school. For example, suppose that we divide x3 − x2 + 2x − 3 by x − 2. x2 + x x − 2 x3 − x2 x3 − 2x2 x2 x2 + 4 + 2x − 3 + 2x − 3 − 2x 4x − 3 4x − 8 5

Hence, x3 − x2 + 2x − 3 = (x − 2)(x2 + x + 4) + 5. Let p(x) be a polynomial in F [x] and α ∈ F . We say that α is a zero or root of p(x) if p(x) is in the kernel of the evaluation homomorphism φα . All we are really saying here is that α is a zero of p(x) if p(α) = 0.

15.2

THE DIVISION ALGORITHM

263

Corollary 15.5 Let F be a ﬁeld. An element α ∈ F is a zero of p(x) ∈ F [x] if and only if x − α is a factor of p(x) in F [x]. Proof. Suppose that α ∈ F and p(α) = 0. By the division algorithm, there exist polynomials q(x) and r(x) such that p(x) = (x − α)q(x) + r(x) and the degree of r(x) must be less than the degree of x − α. Since the degree of r(x) is less than 1, r(x) = a for a ∈ F ; therefore, p(x) = (x − α)q(x) + a. But 0 = p(α) = 0 · q(x) + a = a; consequently, p(x) = (x − α)q(x), and x − α is a factor of p(x). Conversely, suppose that x−α is a factor of p(x); say p(x) = (x−α)q(x). Then p(α) = 0 · q(x) = 0. Corollary 15.6 Let F be a ﬁeld. A nonzero polynomial p(x) of degree n in F [x] can have at most n distinct zeros in F . Proof. We will use induction on the degree of p(x). If deg p(x) = 0, then p(x) is a constant polynomial and has no zeros. Let deg p(x) = 1. Then p(x) = ax + b for some a and b in F . If α1 and α2 are zeros of p(x), then aα1 + b = aα2 + b or α1 = α2 . Now assume that deg p(x) > 1. If p(x) does not have a zero in F , then we are done. On the other hand, if α is a zero of p(x), then p(x) = (x − α)q(x) for some q(x) ∈ F [x] by Corollary 15.5. The degree of q(x) is n − 1 by Proposition 15.2. Let β be some other zero of p(x) that is distinct from α. Then p(β) = (β − α)q(β) = 0. Since α = β and F is a ﬁeld, q(β) = 0. By our induction hypothesis, p(x) can have at most n − 1 zeros in F that are distinct from α. Therefore, p(x) has at most n distinct zeros in F . Let F be a ﬁeld. A monic polynomial d(x) is a greatest common divisor of polynomials p(x), q(x) ∈ F [x] if d(x) evenly divides both p(x) and q(x); and, if for any other polynomial d (x) dividing both p(x) and q(x), d (x) | d(x). We write d(x) = gcd(p(x), q(x)). Two polynomials p(x) and q(x) are relatively prime if gcd(p(x), q(x)) = 1.

264

CHAPTER 15

POLYNOMIALS

Proposition 15.7 Let F be a ﬁeld and suppose that d(x) is the greatest common divisor of two polynomials p(x) and q(x) in F [x]. Then there exist polynomials r(x) and s(x) such that d(x) = r(x)p(x) + s(x)q(x). Furthermore, the greatest common divisor of two polynomials is unique. Proof. Let d(x) be the monic polynomial of smallest degree in the set S = {f (x)p(x) + g(x)q(x) : f (x), g(x) ∈ F [x]}. We can write d(x) = r(x)p(x) + s(x)q(x) for two polynomials r(x) and s(x) in F [x]. We need to show that d(x) divides both p(x) and q(x). We shall ﬁrst show that d(x) divides p(x). By the division algorithm, there exist polynomials a(x) and b(x) such that p(x) = a(x)d(x) + b(x), where b(x) is either the zero polynomial or deg b(x) < deg d(x). Therefore, b(x) = p(x) − a(x)d(x) = p(x) − a(x)(r(x)p(x) + s(x)q(x)) = p(x) − a(x)r(x)p(x) − a(x)s(x)q(x) = p(x)(1 − a(x)r(x)) + q(x)(−a(x)s(x)) is a linear combination of p(x) and q(x) and therefore must be in S. However, b(x) must be the zero polynomial since d(x) was chosen to be of smallest degree; consequently, d(x) divides p(x). A symmetric argument shows that d(x) must also divide q(x); hence, d(x) is a common divisor of p(x) and q(x). To show that d(x) is a greatest common divisor of p(x) and q(x), suppose that d (x) is another common divisor of p(x) and q(x). We will show that d (x) | d(x). Since d (x) is a common divisor of p(x) and q(x), there exist polynomials u(x) and v(x) such that p(x) = u(x)d (x) and q(x) = v(x)d (x). Therefore, d(x) = r(x)p(x) + s(x)q(x) = r(x)u(x)d (x) + s(x)v(x)d (x) = d (x)[r(x)u(x) + s(x)v(x)]. Since d (x) | d(x), d(x) is a greatest common divisor of p(x) and q(x). Finally, we must show that the greatest common divisor of p(x) and q(x)) is unique. Suppose that d (x) is another greatest common divisor of

15.3

p(x) and q(x). We have just shown that there exist polynomials u(x) and v(x) in F [x] such that d(x) = d (x)[r(x)u(x) + s(x)v(x)]. Since deg d(x) = deg d (x) + deg[r(x)u(x) + s(x)v(x)] and d(x) and d (x) are both greatest common divisors, deg d(x) = deg d (x). Since d(x) and d (x) are both monic polynomials of the same degree, it must be the case that d(x) = d (x). Notice the similarity between the proof of Proposition 15.7 and the proof of Theorem 1.4.

15.3

Irreducible Polynomials

A nonconstant polynomial f (x) ∈ F [x] is irreducible over a ﬁeld F if f (x) cannot be expressed as a product of two polynomials g(x) and h(x) in F [x], where the degrees of g(x) and h(x) are both smaller than the degree of f (x). Irreducible polynomials function as the “prime numbers” of polynomial rings. Example 4. The polynomial x2 − 2 ∈ Q[x] is irreducible since it cannot be factored any further over the rational numbers. Similarly, x2 +1 is irreducible over the real numbers. Example 5. The polynomial p(x) = x3 + x2 + 2 is irreducible over Z3 [x]. Suppose that this polynomial was reducible over Z3 [x]. By the division algorithm there would have to be a factor of the form x − a, where a is some element in Z3 [x]. Hence, it would have to be true that p(a) = 0. However, p(0) = 2 p(1) = 1 p(2) = 2. Therefore, p(x) has no zeros in Z3 and must be irreducible. Lemma 15.8 Let p(x) ∈ Q[x]. Then r p(x) = (a0 + a1 x + · · · + an xn ), s where r, s, a0 , . . . , an are integers, the ai ’s are relatively prime, and r and s are relatively prime.

266 Proof. Suppose that p(x) =

CHAPTER 15

POLYNOMIALS

bn b0 b1 + x + · · · + xn , c0 c1 cn

where the bi ’s and the ci ’s are integers. We can rewrite p(x) as p(x) = 1 (d0 + d1 x + · · · + dn xn ), c0 · · · cn

where d0 , . . . , dn are integers. Let d be the greatest common divisor of d0 , . . . , dn . Then p(x) = d (a0 + a1 x + · · · + an xn ), c0 · · · cn

where di = dai and the ai ’s are relatively prime. Reducing d/(c0 · · · cn ) to its lowest terms, we can write r p(x) = (a0 + a1 x + · · · + an xn ), s where gcd(r, s) = 1. Theorem 15.9 (Gauss’s Lemma) Let p(x) ∈ Z[x] be a monic polynomial such that p(x) factors into a product of two polynomials α(x) and β(x) in Q[x], where the degrees of both α(x) and β(x) are less than the degree of p(x). Then p(x) = a(x)b(x), where a(x) and b(x) are monic polynomials in Z[x] with deg α(x) = deg a(x) and deg β(x) = deg b(x). Proof. By Lemma 15.8, we can assume that α(x) = β(x) = c1 c1 (a0 + a1 x + · · · + am xm ) = α1 (x) d1 d1 c2 c2 n (b0 + b1 x + · · · + bn x ) = β1 (x), d2 d2

where the ai ’s are relatively prime and the bi ’s are relatively prime. Consequently, p(x) = α(x)β(x) = c1 c2 c α1 (x)β1 (x) = α1 (x)β1 (x), d1 d2 d

where c/d is the product of c1 /d1 and c2 /d2 expressed in lowest terms. Hence, dp(x) = cα1 (x)β1 (x).

15.3

IRREDUCIBLE POLYNOMIALS

267

If d = 1, then cam bn = 1 since p(x) is a monic polynomial. Hence, either c = 1 or c = −1. If c = 1, then either am = bn = 1 or am = bn = −1. In the ﬁrst case p(x) = α1 (x)β1 (x), where α1 (x) and β1 (x) are monic polynomials with deg α(x) = deg α1 (x) and deg β(x) = deg β1 (x). In the second case a(x) = −α1 (x) and b(x) = −β1 (x) are the correct monic polynomials since p(x) = (−α1 (x))(−β1 (x)) = a(x)b(x). The case in which c = −1 can be handled similarly. Now suppose that d = 1. Since gcd(c, d) = 1, there exists a prime p such that p | d and p | c. Also, since the coeﬃcients of α1 (x) are relatively prime, there exists a coeﬃcient ai such that p | ai . Similarly, there exists a coeﬃcient bj of β1 (x) such that p | bj . Let α1 (x) and β1 (x) be the polynomials in Zp [x] obtained by reducing the coeﬃcients of α1 (x) and β1 (x) modulo p. Since p | d, α1 (x)β1 (x) = 0 in Zp [x]. However, this is impossible since neither α1 (x) nor β1 (x) is the zero polynomial and Zp [x] is an integral domain. Therefore, d = 1 and the theorem is proven. Corollary 15.10 Let p(x) = xn + an−1 xn−1 + · · · + a0 be a polynomial with coeﬃcients in Z and a0 = 0. If p(x) has a zero in Q, then p(x) also has a zero α in Z. Furthermore, α divides a0 . Proof. Let p(x) have a zero a ∈ Q. Then p(x) must have a linear factor x − a. By Gauss’s Lemma, p(x) has a factorization with a linear factor in Z[x]. Hence, for some α ∈ Z p(x) = (x − α)(xn−1 + · · · − a0 /α). Thus a0 /α ∈ Z and so α | a0 . Example 6. Let p(x) = x4 − 2x3 + x + 1. We shall show that p(x) is irreducible over Q[x]. Assume that p(x) is reducible. Then either p(x) has a linear factor, say p(x) = (x − α)q(x), where q(x) is a polynomial of degree three, or p(x) has two quadratic factors. If p(x) has a linear factor in Q[x], then it has a zero in Z. By Corollary 15.10, any zero must divide 1 and therefore must be ±1; however, p(1) = 1 and p(−1) = 3. Consequently, we have eliminated the possibility that p(x) has any linear factors. Therefore, if p(x) is reducible it must factor into two quadratic polynomials, say p(x) = (x2 + ax + b)(x2 + cx + d) = x4 + (a + c)x3 + (ac + b + d)x2 + (ad + bc)x + bd,

268

CHAPTER 15

POLYNOMIALS

where each factor is in Z[x] by Gauss’s Lemma. Hence, a + c = −2 ac + b + d = 0 ad + bc = 1 bd = 1. Since bd = 1, either b = d = 1 or b = d = −1. In either case b = d and so ad + bc = b(a + c) = 1. Since a + c = −2, we know that −2b = 1. This is impossible since b is an integer. Therefore, p(x) must be irreducible over Q. Theorem 15.11 (Eisenstein’s Criterion) Let p be a prime and suppose that f (x) = an xn + · · · + a0 ∈ Z[x]. If p | ai for i = 0, 1, . . . , an−1 , but p | an and p2 | a0 , then f (x) is irreducible over Q. Proof. By Gauss’s Lemma, we need only show that f (x) does not factor into polynomials of lower degree in Z[x]. Let f (x) = (br xr + · · · + b0 )(cs xs + · · · + c0 ) be a factorization in Z[x], with br and cs not equal to zero and r, s < n. Since p2 does not divide a0 = b0 c0 , either b0 or c0 is not divisible by p. Suppose that p | b0 and p | c0 . Since p | an and an = br cs , neither br nor cs is divisible by p. Let m be the smallest value of k such that p | ck . Then am = b0 cm + b1 cm−1 + · · · + bm c0 is not divisible by p, since each term on the right-hand side of the equation is divisible by p except for b0 cm . Therefore, m = n since ai is divisible by p for m < n. Hence, f (x) cannot be factored into polynomials of lower degree and therefore must be irreducible. Example 7. The polynomial p(x) = 16x5 − 9x4 + 3x2 + 6x − 21 is easily seen to be irreducible over Q by Eisenstein’s Criterion if we let p = 3.

15.3

Eisenstein’s Criterion is more useful in constructing irreducible polynomials of a certain degree over Q than in determining the irreducibility of an arbitrary polynomial in Q[x]: given an arbitrary polynomial, it is not very likely that we can apply Eisenstein’s Criterion. The real value of Theorem 15.11 is that we now have an easy method of generating irreducible polynomials of any degree.

Let F be a ﬁeld. Recall that a principal ideal in F [x] is an ideal p(x) generated by some polynomial p(x); that is, p(x) = {p(x)q(x) : q(x) ∈ F [x]}. Example 8. The polynomial x2 in F [x] generates the ideal x2 consisting of all polynomials with no constant term or term of degree 1. Theorem 15.12 If F is a ﬁeld, then every ideal in F [x] is a principal ideal. Proof. Let I be an ideal of F [x]. If I is the zero ideal, the theorem is easily true. Suppose that I is a nontrivial ideal in F [x], and let p(x) ∈ I be a nonzero element of minimal degree. If deg p(x) = 0, then p(x) is a nonzero constant and 1 must be in I. Since 1 generates all of F [x], 1 = I = F [x] and I is again a principal ideal. Now assume that deg p(x) ≥ 1 and let f (x) be any element in I. By the division algorithm there exist q(x) and r(x) in F [x] such that f (x) = p(x)q(x) + r(x) and deg r(x) < deg p(x). Since f (x), p(x) ∈ I and I is an ideal, r(x) = f (x) − p(x)q(x) is also in I. However, since we chose p(x) to be of minimal degree, r(x) must be the zero polynomial. Since we can write any element f (x) in I as p(x)q(x) for some q(x) ∈ F [x], it must be the case that I = p(x) . Example 9. It is not the case that every ideal in the ring F [x, y] is a principal ideal. Consider the ideal of F [x, y] generated by the polynomials x and y. This is the ideal of F [x, y] consisting of all polynomials with no constant term. Since both x and y are in the ideal, no single polynomial can generate the entire ideal. Theorem 15.13 Let F be a ﬁeld and suppose that p(x) ∈ F [x]. Then the ideal generated by p(x) is maximal if and only if p(x) is irreducible.

CHAPTER 15

POLYNOMIALS

Proof. Suppose that p(x) generates a maximal ideal of F [x]. Then p(x) is also a prime ideal of F [x]. Since a maximal ideal must be properly contained inside F [x], p(x) cannot be a constant polynomial. Let us assume that p(x) factors into two polynomials of lesser degree, say p(x) = f (x)g(x). Since p(x) is a prime ideal one of these factors, say f (x), is in p(x) and therefore be a multiple of p(x). But this would imply that p(x) ⊂ f (x) , which is impossible since p(x) is maximal. Conversely, suppose that p(x) is irreducible over F [x]. Let I be an ideal in F [x] containing p(x) . By Theorem 15.12, I is a principal ideal; hence, I = f (x) for some f (x) ∈ F [x]. Since p(x) ∈ I, it must be the case that p(x) = f (x)g(x) for some g(x) ∈ F [x]. However, p(x) is irreducible; hence, either f (x) or g(x) is a constant polynomial. If f (x) is constant, then I = F [x] and we are done. If g(x) is constant, then f (x) is a constant multiple of I and I = p(x) . Thus, there are no proper ideals of F [x] that properly contain p(x) . Historical Note
Throughout history, the solution of polynomial equations has been a challenging problem. The Babylonians knew how to solve the equation ax2 + bx + c = 0. Omar Khayyam (1048–1131) devised methods of solving cubic equations through the use of geometric constructions and conic sections. The algebraic solution of the general cubic equation ax3 + bx2 + cx + d = 0 was not discovered until the sixteenth century. An Italian mathematician, Luca Paciola (ca. 1445–1509), wrote in Summa de Arithmetica that the solution of the cubic was impossible. This was taken as a challenge by the rest of the mathematical community. Scipione del Ferro (1465–1526), of the University of Bologna, solved the “depressed cubic,” ax3 + cx + d = 0. He kept his solution an absolute secret. This may seem surprising today, when mathematicians are usually very eager to publish their results, but in the days of the Italian Renaissance secrecy was customary. Academic appointments were not easy to secure and depended on the ability to prevail in public contests. Such challenges could be issued at any time. Consequently, any major new discovery was a valuable weapon in such a contest. If an opponent presented a list of problems to be solved, del Ferro could in turn present a list of depressed cubics. He kept the secret of his discovery throughout his life, passing it on only on his deathbed to his student Antonio Fior (ca. 1506–?). Although Fior was not the equal of his teacher, he immediately issued a challenge to Niccolo Fontana (1499–1557). Fontana was known as Tartaglia (the Stammerer). As a youth he had suﬀered a blow from the sword of a French soldier during an attack on his village. He survived the savage wound, but his speech was perma-

nently impaired. Tartaglia sent Fior a list of 30 various mathematical problems; Fior countered by sending Tartaglia a list of 30 depressed cubics. Tartaglia would either solve all 30 of the problems or absolutely fail. After much eﬀort Tartaglia ﬁnally succeeded in solving the depressed cubic and defeated Fior, who faded into obscurity. At this point another mathematician, Gerolamo Cardano (1501–1576), entered the story. Cardano wrote to Tartaglia, begging him for the solution to the depressed cubic. Tartaglia refused several of his requests, then ﬁnally revealed the solution to Cardano after the latter swore an oath not to publish the secret or to pass it on to anyone else. Using the knowledge that he had obtained from Tartaglia, Cardano eventually solved the general cubic ax3 + bx2 + cx + d = 0. Cardano shared the secret with his student, Ludovico Ferrari (1522–1565), who solved the general quartic equation, ax4 + bx3 + cx2 + dx + e = 0. In 1543, Cardano and Ferrari examined del Ferro’s papers and discovered that he had also solved the depressed cubic. Cardano felt that this relieved him of his obligation to Tartaglia, so he proceeded to publish the solutions in Ars Magna (1545), in which he gave credit to del Ferro for solving the special case of the cubic. This resulted in a bitter dispute between Cardano and Tartaglia, who published the story of the oath a year later.

Integral Domains

One of the most important rings we study is the ring of integers. It was our ﬁrst example of an algebraic structure: the ﬁrst polynomial ring that we examined was Z[x]. We also know that the integers sit naturally inside the ﬁeld of rational numbers, Q. The ring of integers is the model for all integral domains. In this chapter we will examine integral domains in general, answering questions about the ideal structure of integral domains, polynomial rings over integral domains, and whether or not an integral domain can be embedded in a ﬁeld.

16.1

Fields of Fractions

Every ﬁeld is also an integral domain; however, there are many integral domains that are not ﬁelds. For example, the integers Z are an integral domain but not a ﬁeld. A question that naturally arises is how we might associate an integral domain with a ﬁeld. There is a natural way to construct the rationals Q from the integers: the rationals can be represented as formal quotients of two integers. The rational numbers are certainly a ﬁeld. In fact, it can be shown that the rationals are the smallest ﬁeld that contains the integers. Given an integral domain D, our question now becomes how to construct a smallest ﬁeld F containing D. We will do this in the same way as we constructed the rationals from the integers. An element p/q ∈ Q is the quotient of two integers p and q; however, diﬀerent pairs of integers can represent the same rational number. For instance, 1/2 = 2/4 = 3/6. We know that a c = b d if and only if ad = bc. A more formal way of considering this problem is to examine fractions in terms of equivalence relations. We can think of 277

278

CHAPTER 16

INTEGRAL DOMAINS

elements in Q as ordered pairs in Z × Z. A quotient p/q can be written as (p, q). For instance, (3, 7) would represent the fraction 3/7. However, there are problems if we consider all possible pairs in Z × Z. There is no fraction 5/0 corresponding to the pair (5, 0). Also, the pairs (3, 6) and (2, 4) both represent the fraction 1/2. The ﬁrst problem is easily solved if we require the second coordinate to be nonzero. The second problem is solved by considering two pairs (a, b) and (c, d) to be equivalent if ad = bc. If we use the approach of ordered pairs instead of fractions, then we can study integral domains in general. Let D be any integral domain and let S = {(a, b) : a, b ∈ D and b = 0}. Deﬁne a relation on S by (a, b) ∼ (c, d) if ad = bc. Lemma 16.1 The relation ∼ between elements of S is an equivalence relation. Proof. Since D is commutative, ab = ba; hence, ∼ is reﬂexive on D. Now suppose that (a, b) ∼ (c, d). Then ad = bc or cb = da. Therefore, (c, d) ∼ (a, b) and the relation is symmetric. Finally, to show that the relation is transitive, let (a, b) ∼ (c, d) and (c, d) ∼ (e, f ). In this case ad = bc and cf = de. Multiplying both sides of ad = bc by f yields af d = adf = bcf = bde = bed. Since D is an integral domain, we can deduce that af = be or (a, b) ∼ (e, f ). We will denote the set of equivalence classes on S by FD . We now need to deﬁne the operations of addition and multiplication on FD . Recall how fractions are added and multiplied in Q: a + b a · b c d c d = = ad + bc ; bd ac . bd

It seems reasonable to deﬁne the operations of addition and multiplication on FD in a similar manner. If we denote the equivalence class of (a, b) ∈ S by [a, b], then we are led to deﬁne the operations of addition and multiplication on FD by [a, b] + [c, d] = [ad + bc, bd]

16.1 and

[a, b] · [c, d] = [ac, bd], respectively. The next lemma demonstrates that these operations are independent of the choice of representatives from each equivalence class. Lemma 16.2 The operations of addition and multiplication on FD are welldeﬁned. Proof. We will prove that the operation of addition is well-deﬁned. The proof that multiplication is well-deﬁned is left as an exercise. Let [a1 , b1 ] = [a2 , b2 ] and [c1 , d1 ] = [c2 , d2 ]. We must show that [a1 d1 + b1 c1 , b1 d1 ] = [a2 d2 + b2 c2 , b2 d2 ] or, equivalently, that (a1 d1 + b1 c1 )(b2 d2 ) = (b1 d1 )(a2 d2 + b2 c2 ). Since [a1 , b1 ] = [a2 , b2 ] and [c1 , d1 ] = [c2 , d2 ], we know that a1 b2 = b1 a2 and c1 d2 = d1 c2 . Therefore, (a1 d1 + b1 c1 )(b2 d2 ) = a1 d1 b2 d2 + b1 c1 b2 d2 = a1 b2 d1 d2 + b1 b2 c1 d2 = b1 a2 d1 d2 + b1 b2 d1 c2 = (b1 d1 )(a2 d2 + b2 c2 ).

Lemma 16.3 The set of equivalence classes of S, FD , under the equivalence relation ∼, together with the operations of addition and multiplication deﬁned by [a, b] + [c, d] = [ad + bc, bd] [a, b] · [c, d] = [ac, bd], is a ﬁeld. Proof. The additive and multiplicative identities are [0, 1] and [1, 1], respectively. To show that [0, 1] is the additive identity, observe that [a, b] + [0, 1] = [a1 + b0, b1] = [a, b].

280

CHAPTER 16

INTEGRAL DOMAINS

It is easy to show that [1, 1] is the multiplicative identity. Let [a, b] ∈ FD such that a = 0. Then [b, a] is also in FD and [a, b] · [b, a] = [1, 1]; hence, [b, a] is the multiplicative inverse for [a, b]. Similarly, [−a, b] is the additive inverse of [a, b]. We leave as exercises the veriﬁcation of the associative and commutative properties of multiplication in FD . We also leave it to the reader to show that FD is an abelian group under addition. It remains to show that the distributive property holds in FD ; however, [a, b][e, f ] + [c, d][e, f ] = [ae, bf ] + [ce, df ] = [aedf + bf ce, bdf 2 ] = [aed + bce, bdf ] = [ade + bce, bdf ] = ([a, b] + [c, d])[e, f ] and the lemma is proved. The ﬁeld FD in Lemma 16.3 is called the ﬁeld of fractions or ﬁeld of quotients of the integral domain D. Theorem 16.4 Let D be an integral domain. Then D can be embedded in a ﬁeld of fractions FD , where any element in FD can be expressed as the quotient of two elements in D. Furthermore, the ﬁeld of fractions FD is unique in the sense that if E is any ﬁeld containing D, then there exists a map ψ : FD → E giving an isomorphism with a subﬁeld of E such that ψ(a) = a for all elements a ∈ D. Proof. We will ﬁrst demonstrate that D can be embedded in the ﬁeld FD . Deﬁne a map φ : D → FD by φ(a) = [a, 1]. Then for a and b in D, φ(a + b) = [a + b, 1] = [a, 1] + [b, 1] = φ(a) + φ(b) and φ(ab) = [ab, 1] = [a, 1][b, 1] = φ(a)φ(b); hence, φ is a homomorphism. To show that φ is one-to-one, suppose that φ(a) = φ(b). Then [a, 1] = [b, 1], or a = a1 = 1b = b. Finally, any element of FD can expressed as the quotient of two elements in D, since φ(a)[φ(b)]−1 = [a, 1][b, 1]−1 = [a, 1] · [1, b] = [a, b]. Now let E be a ﬁeld containing D and deﬁne a map ψ : FD → E by ψ([a, b]) = ab−1 . To show that ψ is well-deﬁned, let [a1 , b1 ] = [a2 , b2 ]. Then a1 b2 = b1 a2 . Therefore, a1 b−1 = a2 b−1 and ψ([a1 , b1 ]) = ψ([a2 , b2 ]). 1 2

If [a, b] and [c, d] are in FD , then ψ([a, b] + [c, d]) = ψ([ad + bc, bd]) = (ad + bc)(bd)−1 = ab−1 + cd−1 = ψ([a, b]) + ψ([c, d]) and ψ([a, b] · [c, d]) = ψ([ac, bd]) = (ac)(bd)−1 = ab−1 cd−1 = ψ([a, b])ψ([c, d]). Therefore, ψ is a homomorphism. To complete the proof of the theorem, we need to show that ψ is one-toone. Suppose that ψ([a, b]) = ab−1 = 0. Then a = 0b = 0 and [a, b] = [0, b]. Therefore, the kernel of ψ is the zero element [0, b] in FD , and ψ is injective. Example 1. Since Q is a ﬁeld, Q[x] is an integral domain. The ﬁeld of fractions of Q[x] is the set of all rational expressions p(x)/q(x), where p(x) and q(x) are polynomials over the rationals and q(x) is not the zero polynomial. We will denote this ﬁeld by Q(x). We will leave the proofs of the following corollaries of Theorem 16.4 as exercises. Corollary 16.5 Let F be a ﬁeld of characteristic zero. Then F contains a subﬁeld isomorphic to Q. Corollary 16.6 Let F be a ﬁeld of characteristic p. Then F contains a subﬁeld isomorphic to Zp .

16.2

Factorization in Integral Domains

The building blocks of the integers are the prime numbers. If F is a ﬁeld, then irreducible polynomials in F [x] play a role that is very similar to that of the prime numbers in the ring of integers. Given an arbitrary integral domain, we are led to the following series of deﬁnitions.

CHAPTER 16

INTEGRAL DOMAINS

Let R be a commutative ring with identity, and let a and b be elements in R. We say that a divides b, and write a | b, if there exists an element c ∈ R such that b = ac. A unit in R is an element that has a multiplicative inverse. Two elements a and b in R are said to be associates if there exists a unit u in R such that a = ub. Let D be an integral domain. A nonzero element p ∈ D that is not a unit is said to be irreducible provided that whenever p = ab, either a or b is a unit. Furthermore, p is prime if whenever p | ab either p | a or p | b. Example 2. It is important to notice that prime and irreducible elements do not always coincide. Let R be the subring of Q[x, y] generated by x2 , y 2 , and xy. Each of these elements is irreducible in R; however, xy is not prime, since xy divides x2 y 2 but does not divide either x2 or y 2 . The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic states that every positive integer n > 1 can be factored into a product of prime numbers p1 · · · pk , where the pi ’s are not necessarily distinct. We also know that such factorizations are unique up to the order of the pi ’s. We can easily extend this result to the integers. The question arises of whether or not such factorizations are possible in other rings. Generalizing this deﬁnition, we say an integral domain D is a unique factorization domain, or UFD, if D satisﬁes the following criteria. 1. Let a ∈ D such that a = 0 and a is not a unit. Then a can be written as the product of irreducible elements in D. 2. Let a = p1 · · · pr = q1 · · · qs , where the pi ’s and the qi ’s are irreducible. Then r = s and there is a π ∈ Sk such that pi = qπ(j) for j = 1, . . . , r = s. Example 3. The integers are a unique factorization domain by the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. Example 4. Not every integral domain is a unique factorization domain. √ √ The subring Z[ 3 i] = {a + b 3 i} of the complex numbers is an inte√ gral domain (Exercise 12, Chapter 14). Let z = a + b 3 i and deﬁne √ ν : Z[ 3 i] → N ∪ {0} by ν(z) = |z|2 = a2 + 3b2 . It is clear that ν(z) ≥ 0 with equality when z = 0. Also, from our knowledge of complex numbers we know that ν(zw) = ν(z)ν(w). It is √ to show that if ν(z) = 1, then z easy is a unit, and that the only units of Z[ 3 i] are 1 and −1. We claim that 4 has two distinct factorizations into irreducible elements: √ √ 4 = 2 · 2 = (1 − 3 i)(1 + 3 i).

√ We must show that each of these factors is an irreducible element in Z[ 3 i]. √ If 2 is not irreducible, then 2 = zw for elements z, w in Z[ 3 i] where √ ν(z) = ν(w) = 2. However, there does not exist an element in z in Z[ 3 i] such that ν(z) = 2 because the equation a2 +3b2 = 2 has no integer solutions. Therefore, 2 must be irreducible. A similar argument shows that both 1 − √ √ 3 i and 1 + √ i are irreducible. Since 2 is not a unit multiple of either 3 √ 1 − 3 i or 1 + 3 i, 4 has at least two distinct factorizations into irreducible elements.

Principal Ideal Domains
Let R be a commutative ring with identity. Recall that a principal ideal generated by a ∈ R is an ideal of the form a = {ra : r ∈ R}. An integral domain in which every ideal is principal is called a principal ideal domain, or PID. Lemma 16.7 Let D be an integral domain and let a, b ∈ D. Then 1. a | b ⇔ b ⊂ a . 2. a and b are associates ⇔ b = a . 3. a is a unit in D ⇔ a = D. Proof. (1) Suppose that a | b. Then b = ax for some x ∈ D. Hence, for every r in D, br = (ax)r = a(xr) and b ⊂ a . Conversely, suppose that b ⊂ a . Then b ∈ a . Consequently, b = ax for some x ∈ D. Thus, a | b. (2) Since a and b are associates, there exists a unit u such that a = ub. Therefore, b | a and a ⊂ b . Similarly, b ⊂ a . It follows that a = b . Conversely, suppose that a = b . By part (1), a | b and b | a. Then a = bx and b = ay for some x, y ∈ D. Therefore, a = bx = ayx. Since D is an integral domain, xy = 1; that is, x and y are units and a and b are associates. (3) An element a ∈ D is a unit if and only if a is an associate of 1. However, a is an associate of 1 if and only if a = 1 = D. Theorem 16.8 Let D be a PID and p be a nonzero ideal in D. Then p is a maximal ideal if and only if p is irreducible. Proof. Suppose that p is a maximal ideal. If some element a in D divides p, then p ⊂ a . Since p is maximal, either D = a or p = a .

Consequently, either a and p are associates or a is a unit. Therefore, p is irreducible. Conversely, let p be irreducible. If a is an ideal in D such that p ⊂ a ⊂ D, then a | p. Since p is irreducible, either a must be a unit or a and p are associates. Therefore, either D = a or p = a . Thus, p is a maximal ideal. Corollary 16.9 Let D be a PID. If p is irreducible, then p is prime. Proof. Let p be irreducible and suppose that p | ab. Then ab ⊂ p . By Corollary 14.17, since p is a maximal ideal, p must also be a prime ideal. Thus, either a ∈ p or b ∈ p . Hence, either p | a or p | b. Lemma 16.10 Let D be a PID. Let I1 , I2 , . . . be a set of ideals such that I1 ⊂ I2 ⊂ · · · . Then there exists an integer N such that In = IN for all n ≥ N. Proof. We claim that I = ∞ is an ideal of D. Certainly I is not empty, i=1 since I1 ⊂ I and 0 ∈ I. If a, b ∈ I, then a ∈ Ii and b ∈ Ij for some i and j in N. Without loss of generality we can assume that i ≤ j. Hence, a and b are both in Ij and so a − b is also in Ij . Now let r ∈ D and a ∈ I. Again, we note that a ∈ Ii for some positive integer i. Since Ii is an ideal, ra ∈ Ii and hence must be in I. Therefore, we have shown that I is an ideal in D. Since D is a principal ideal domain, there exists an element a ∈ D that generates I. Since a is in IN for some N ∈ N, we know that IN = I = a . Consequently, In = IN for n ≥ N . Any commutative ring satisfying the condition in Lemma 16.10 is said to satisfy the ascending chain condition, or ACC. Such rings are called Noetherian rings, after Emmy Noether. Theorem 16.11 Every PID is a UFD. Proof. Existence of a factorization. Let D be a PID and a be a nonzero element in D that is not a unit. If a is irreducible, then we are done. If not, then there exists a factorization a = a1 b1 , where neither a1 nor b1 is a unit. Hence, a ⊂ a1 . By Lemma 16.7, we know that a = a1 ; otherwise, a and a1 would be associates and b1 would be a unit, which would contradict our assumption. Now suppose that a1 = a2 b2 , where neither a2 nor b2 is a unit. By the same argument as before, a1 ⊂ a2 . We can continue with this construction to obtain an ascending chain of ideals a ⊂ a1 ⊂ a2 ⊂ · · · .

By Lemma 16.10, there exists a positive integer N such that an = aN for all n ≥ N . Consequently, aN must be irreducible. We have now shown that a is the product of two elements, one of which must be irreducible. Now suppose that a = c1 p1 , where p1 is irreducible. If c1 is not a unit, we can repeat the preceding argument to conclude that a ⊂ c1 . Either c1 is irreducible or c1 = c2 p2 , where p2 is irreducible and c2 is not a unit. Continuing in this manner, we obtain another chain of ideals a ⊂ c1 ⊂ c2 ⊂ · · · . This chain must satisfy the ascending chain condition; therefore, a = p1 p2 · · · pr for irreducible elements p1 , . . . , pr . Uniqueness of the factorization. To show uniqueness, let a = p1 p2 · · · pr = q1 q2 · · · qs , where each pi and each qi is irreducible. Without loss of generality, we can assume that r < s. Since p1 divides q1 q2 · · · qs , by Corollary 16.9 it must divide some qi . By rearranging the qi ’s, we can assume that p1 | q1 ; hence, q1 = u1 p1 for some unit u1 in D. Therefore, a = p1 p2 · · · pr = u1 p1 q2 · · · qs or p2 · · · pr = u1 q2 · · · qs . Continuing in this manner, we can arrange the qi ’s such that p2 = q2 , p3 = q3 , . . . , pr = qr , to obtain u1 u2 · · · ur qr+1 · · · qs = 1. In this case qr+1 · · · qs is a unit, which contradicts the fact that qr+1 , . . . , qs are irreducibles. Therefore, r = s and the factorization of a is unique. Corollary 16.12 Let F be a ﬁeld. Then F [x] is a UFD. Example 5. Every PID is a UFD, but it is not the case that every UFD is a PID. In Corollary 16.22, we will prove that Z[x] is a UFD. However, Z[x] is not a PID. Let I = {5f (x) + xg(x) : f (x), g(x) ∈ Z[x]}. We can easily show that I is an ideal of Z[x]. Suppose that I = p(x) . Since 5 ∈ I, 5 = f (x)p(x). In this case p(x) = p must be a constant. Since x ∈ I, x = pg(x); consequently, p = ±1. However, it follows from this fact that p(x) = Z[x]. But this would mean that 3 is in I. Therefore, we can write 3 = 5f (x) + xg(x) for some f (x) and g(x) in Z[x]. Examining the constant term of this polynomial, we see that 3 = 5f (x), which is impossible.

Euclidean Domains
We have repeatedly used the division algorithm when proving results about either Z or F [x], where F is a ﬁeld. We should now ask when a division algorithm is available for an integral domain. Let D be an integral domain such that for each a ∈ D there is a nonnegative integer ν(a) satisfying the following conditions. 1. If a and b are nonzero elements in D, then ν(a) ≤ ν(ab). 2. Let a, b ∈ D and suppose that b = 0. Then there exist elements q, r ∈ D such that a = bq + r and either r = 0 or ν(r) < ν(b). Then D is called a Euclidean domain and ν is called a Euclidean valuation. Example 6. Absolute value on Z is a Euclidean valuation. Example 7. Let F be a ﬁeld. Then the degree of a polynomial in F [x] is a Euclidean valuation. Example 8. Recall that the Gaussian integers in Example 9 of Chapter 14 are deﬁned by Z[i] = {a + bi : a, b ∈ Z}. We usually measure the size of a complex number a + bi by its absolute √ √ value, |a + bi| = a2 + b2 ; however, a2 + b2 may not be an integer. For our valuation we will let ν(a+bi) = a2 +b2 to ensure that we have an integer. We claim that ν(a + bi) = a2 + b2 is a Euclidean valuation on Z[i]. Let z, w ∈ Z[i]. Then ν(zw) = |zw|2 = |z|2 |w|2 = ν(z)ν(w). Since ν(z) ≥ 1 for every nonzero z ∈ Z[i], ν(z) = ν(z)ν(w). Next, we must show that for any z = a + bi and w = c + di in Z[i] with w = 0, there exist elements q and r in Z[i] such that z = qw + r with either r = 0 or ν(r) < ν(w). We can view z and w as elements in Q(i) = {p + qi : p, q ∈ Q}, the ﬁeld of fractions of Z[i]. Observe that zw−1 = (a + bi) = = = = c − di c2 + d2 ac + bd bc − ad + 2 i c2 + d2 c + d2 n1 n2 m1 + 2 + m2 + 2 i 2 c +d c + d2 n1 n2 + i (m1 + m2 i) + c2 + d2 c2 + d2 (m1 + m2 i) + (s + ti)

in Q(i). In the last steps we are writing the real and imaginary parts as an integer plus a proper fraction. That is, we take the closest integer mi such that the fractional part satisﬁes |ni /(a2 + b2 )| ≤ 1/2. For example, we write 9 8 15 8 1 8 1 = 2− . 8 = 1+

Thus, s and t are the “fractional parts” of zw−1 = (m1 + m2 i) + (s + ti). We also know that s2 + t2 ≤ 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2. Multiplying by w, we have z = zw−1 w = w(m1 + m2 i) + w(s + ti) = qw + r, where q = m1 + m2 i and r = w(s + ti). Since z and qw are in Z[i], r must be in Z[i]. Finally, we need to show that either r = 0 or ν(r) < ν(w). However, 1 ν(r) = ν(w)ν(s + ti) ≤ ν(w) < ν(w). 2

Theorem 16.13 Every Euclidean domain is a principal ideal domain. Proof. Let D be a Euclidean domain and let ν be a Euclidean valuation on D. Suppose I is a nontrivial ideal in D and choose a nonzero element b ∈ I such that ν(b) is minimal for all a ∈ I. Since D is a Euclidean domain, there exist elements q and r in D such that a = bq + r and either r = 0 or ν(r) < ν(b). But r = a − bq is in I since I is an ideal; therefore, r = 0 by the minimality of b. It follows that a = bq and I = b . Corollary 16.14 Every Euclidean domain is a unique factorization domain.

Factorization in D[x]
One of the most important polynomial rings is Z[x]. One of the ﬁrst questions that come to mind about Z[x] is whether or not it is a UFD. We will prove a more general statement here. Our ﬁrst task is to obtain a more general version of Gauss’s Lemma (Theorem 15.9). Let D be a unique factorization domain and suppose that p(x) = an xn + · · · + a1 x + a0

288

CHAPTER 16

in D[x]. Then the content of p(x) is the greatest common divisor of a0 , . . . , a1 . We say that p(x) is primitive if gcd(a0 , . . . , an ) = 1. Example 9. In Z[x] the polynomial p(x) = 5x4 − 3x3 + x − 4 is a primitive polynomial since the greatest common divisor of the coeﬃcients is 1; however, the polynomial q(x) = 4x2 − 6x + 8 is not primitive since the content of q(x) is 2. Theorem 16.15 (Gauss’s Lemma) Let D be a UFD and let f (x) and g(x) be primitive polynomials in D[x]. Then f (x)g(x) is primitive. Proof. Let f (x) = m ai xi and g(x) = n bi xi . Suppose that p is i=0 i=0 a prime dividing the coeﬃcients of f (x)g(x). Let r be the smallest integer such that p | ar and s be the smallest integer such that p | bs . The coeﬃcient of xr+s in f (x)g(x) is cr+s = a0 br+s + a1 br+s−1 + · · · + ar+s−1 b1 + ar+s b0 . Since p divides a0 , . . . , ar−1 and b0 , . . . , bs−1 , p divides every term of cr+s except for the term ar bs . However, since p | cr+s , either p divides ar or p divides bs . But this is impossible. Lemma 16.16 Let D be a UFD, and let p(x) and q(x) be in D[x]. Then the content of p(x)q(x) is equal to the product of the contents of p(x) and q(x). Proof. Let p(x) = cp1 (x) and q(x) = dq1 (x), where c and d are the contents of p(x) and q(x), respectively. Then p1 (x) and q1 (x) are primitive. We can now write p(x)q(x) = cdp1 (x)q1 (x). Since p1 (x)q1 (x) is primitive, the content of p(x)q(x) must be cd. Lemma 16.17 Let D be a UFD and F its ﬁeld of fractions. Suppose that p(x) ∈ D[x] and p(x) = f (x)g(x), where f (x) and g(x) are in F [x]. Then p(x) = f1 (x)g1 (x), where f1 (x) and g1 (x) are in D[x]. Furthermore, deg f (x) = deg f1 (x) and deg g(x) = deg g1 (x). Proof. Let a and b be nonzero elements of D such that af (x), bg(x) are in D[x]. We can ﬁnd a1 , b2 ∈ D such that af (x) = a1 f1 (x) and bg(x) = b1 g1 (x), where f1 (x) and g1 (x) are primitive polynomials in D[x]. Therefore, abp(x) = (a1 f1 (x))(b1 g1 (x)). Since f1 (x) and g1 (x) are primitive polynomials, it must be the case that ab | a1 b1 by Gauss’s Lemma. Thus there exists a c ∈ D such that p(x) = cf1 (x)g1 (x). Clearly, deg f (x) = deg f1 (x) and deg g(x) = deg g1 (x). The following corollaries are direct consequences of Lemma 16.17.

Corollary 16.18 Let D be a UFD and F its ﬁeld of fractions. A primitive polynomial p(x) in D[x] is irreducible in F [x] if and only if it is irreducible in D[x]. Corollary 16.19 Let D be a UFD and F its ﬁeld of fractions. If p(x) is a monic polynomial in D[x] with p(x) = f (x)g(x) in F [x], then p(x) = f1 (x)g1 (x), where f1 (x) and g1 (x) are in D[x]. Furthermore, deg f (x) = deg f1 (x) and deg g(x) = deg g1 (x). Theorem 16.20 If D is a UFD, then D[x] is a UFD. Proof. Let p(x) be a nonzero polynomial in D[x]. If p(x) is a constant polynomial, then it must have a unique factorization since D is a UFD. Now suppose that p(x) is a polynomial of positive degree in D[x]. Let F be the ﬁeld of fractions of D, and let p(x) = f1 (x)f2 (x) · · · fn (x) by a factorization of p(x), where each fi (x) is irreducible. Choose ai ∈ D such that ai fi (x) is in D[x]. There exist b1 , . . . , bn ∈ D such that ai fi (x) = bi gi (x), where gi (x) is a primitive polynomial in D[x]. By Corollary 16.18, each gi (x) is irreducible in D[x]. Consequently, we can write a1 · · · an p(x) = b1 · · · bn g1 (x) · · · gn (x). Let b = b1 · · · bn . Since g1 (x) · · · gn (x) is primitive, a1 · · · an divides b. Therefore, p(x) = ag1 (x) · · · gn (x), where a ∈ D. Since D is a UFD, we can factor a as uc1 · · · ck , where u is a unit and each of the ci ’s is irreducible in D. We will now show the uniqueness of this factorization. Let p(x) = a1 · · · am f1 (x) · · · fn (x) = b1 · · · br g1 (x) · · · gs (x) be two factorizations of p(x), where all of the factors are irreducible in D[x]. By Corollary 16.18, each of the fi ’s and gi ’s is irreducible in F [x]. The ai ’s and the bi ’s are units in F . Since F [x] is a PID, it is a UFD; therefore, n = s. Now rearrange the gi (x)’s so that fi (x) and gi (x) are associates for i = 1, . . . , n. Then there exist c1 , . . . , cn and d1 , . . . , dn in D such that (ci /di )fi (x) = gi (x) or ci fi (x) = di gi (x). The polynomials fi (x) and gi (x) are primitive; hence, ci and di are associates in D. Thus, a1 · · · am = ub1 · · · br in D, where u is a unit in D. Since D is a unique factorization domain, m = s. Finally, we can reorder the bi ’s so that ai and bi are associates for each i. This completes the uniqueness part of the proof. The theorem that we have just proven has several obvious but important corollaries.

Corollary 16.21 Let F be a ﬁeld. Then F [x] is a UFD. Corollary 16.22 Z[x] is a UFD. Corollary 16.23 Let D be a UFD. Then D[x1 , . . . , xn ] is a UFD. Remark. It is important to notice that every Euclidean domain is a PID and every PID is a UFD. However, as demonstrated by our examples, the converse of each of these statements fails. There are principal ideal domains that are not Euclidean domains, and there are unique factorization domains that are not principal ideal domains (Z[x]). Historical Note Karl Friedrich Gauss, born in Brunswick, Germany on April 30, 1777, is considered to be one of the greatest mathematicians who ever lived. Gauss was truly a child prodigy. At the age of three he was able to detect errors in the books of his father’s business. Gauss entered college at the age of 15. Before the age of 20, Gauss was able to construct a regular 17-sided polygon with a ruler and compass. This was the ﬁrst new construction of a regular n-sided polygon since the time of the ancient Greeks. Gauss succeeded in n showing that if N = 22 + 1 was prime, then it was possible to construct a regular N -sided polygon. Gauss obtained his Ph.D. in 1799 under the direction of Pfaﬀ at the University of Helmstedt. In his dissertation he gave the ﬁrst complete proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, which states that every polynomial with real coeﬃcients can be factored into linear factors over the complex numbers. The acceptance of complex numbers was brought about by Gauss, √ who was the ﬁrst person to use the notation of i for −1. Gauss then turned his attention toward number theory; in 1801, he published his famous book on number theory, Disquisitiones Arithmeticae. Throughout his life Gauss was intrigued with this branch of mathematics. He once wrote, “Mathematics is the queen of the sciences, and the theory of numbers is the queen of mathematics.” In 1807, Gauss was appointed director of the Observatory at the University of G¨ttingen, a position he held until his death. This position required o him to study applications of mathematics to the sciences. He succeeded in making contributions to ﬁelds such as astronomy, mechanics, optics, geodesy, and magnetism. Along with Wilhelm Weber, he coinvented the ﬁrst practical electric telegraph some years before a better version was invented by Samuel F. B. Morse.

Gauss was clearly the most prominent mathematician in the world in the early nineteenth century. His status naturally made his discoveries subject to intense scrutiny. Gauss’s cold and distant personality many times led him to ignore the work of his contemporaries, making him many enemies. He did not enjoy teaching very much, and young mathematicians who sought him out for encouragement were often rebuﬀed. Nevertheless, he had many outstanding students, including Eisenstein, Riemann, Kummer, Dirichlet, and Dedekind. Gauss also oﬀered a great deal of encouragement to Sophie Germain (1776–1831), who overcame the many obstacles facing women in her day to become a very prominent mathematician. Gauss died at the age of 78 in G¨ttingen on February 23, 1855. o

Lattices and Boolean Algebras

The axioms of a ring give structure to the operations of addition and multiplication on a set. However, we can construct algebraic structures, known as lattices and Boolean algebras, that generalize other types of operations. For example, the important operations on sets are inclusion, union, and intersection. Lattices are generalizations of order relations on algebraic spaces, such as set inclusion in set theory and inequality in the familiar number systems N, Z, Q, and R. Boolean algebras generalize the operations of intersection and union. Lattices and Boolean algebras have found applications in logic, circuit theory, and probability.

17.1

Lattices

Partially Ordered Sets
We begin by the study of lattices and Boolean algebras by generalizing the idea of inequality. Recall that a relation on a set X is a subset of X × X. A relation P on X is called a partial order of X if it satisﬁes the following axioms. 1. The relation is reﬂexive: (a, a) ∈ P for all a ∈ X. 2. The relation is antisymmetric: if (a, b) ∈ P and (b, a) ∈ P , then a = b. 3. The relation is transitive: if (a, b) ∈ P and (b, c) ∈ P , then (a, c) ∈ P . 294

We will usually write a b to mean (a, b) ∈ P unless some symbol is naturally associated with a particular partial order, such as a ≤ b with integers a and b, or X ⊆ Y with sets X and Y . A set X together with a partial order is called a partially ordered set, or poset. Example 1. The set of integers (or rationals or reals) is a poset where a ≤ b has the usual meaning for two integers a and b in Z. Example 2. Let X be any set. We will deﬁne the power set of X to be the set of all subsets of X. We denote the power set of X by P(X). For example, let X = {a, b, c}. Then P(X) is the set of all subsets of the set {a, b, c}: ∅ {a} {b} {c} {a, b} {a, c} {b, c} {a, b, c}. On any power set of a set X, set inclusion, ⊆, is a partial order. We can represent the order on {a, b, c} schematically by a diagram such as the one in Figure 17.1. {a, b, c}

Figure 17.1. Partial order on P({a, b, c}) Example 3. Let G be a group. The set of subgroups of G is a poset, where the partial order is set inclusion. Example 4. There can be more than one partial order on a particular set. We can form a partial order on N by a b if a | b. The relation is certainly reﬂexive since a | a for all a ∈ N. If m | n and n | m, then m = n; hence, the relation is also antisymmetric. The relation is transitive, because if m | n and n | p, then m | p. Example 5. Let X = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24} be the set of divisors of 24 with the partial order deﬁned in Example 4. Figure 17.2 shows the partial order on X.

Figure 17.2. A partial order on the divisors of 24 Let Y be a subset of a poset X. An element u in X is an upper bound of Y if a u for every element a ∈ Y . If u is an upper bound of Y such that u v for every other upper bound v of Y , then u is called a least upper bound or supremum of Y . An element l in X is said to be a lower bound of Y if l a for all a ∈ Y . If l is a lower bound of Y such that k l for every other lower bound k of Y , then l is called a greatest lower bound or inﬁmum of Y . Example 6. Let Y = {2, 3, 4, 6} be contained in the set X of Example 5. Then Y has upper bounds 12 and 24, with 12 as a least upper bound. The only lower bound is 1; hence, it must be a greatest lower bound. As it turns out, least upper bounds and greatest lower bounds are unique if they exist. Theorem 17.1 Let Y be a nonempty subset of a poset X. If Y has a least upper bound, then Y has a unique least upper bound. If Y has a greatest lower bound, then Y has a unique greatest lower bound. Proof. Let u1 and u2 be least upper bounds for Y . By the deﬁnition of the least upper bound, u1 u for all upper bounds u of Y . In particular, u1 u2 . Similarly, u2 u1 . Therefore, u1 = u2 by antisymmetry. A similar argument show that the greatest lower bound is unique. On many posets it is possible to deﬁne binary operations by using the greatest lower bound and the least upper bound of two elements. A lattice is a poset L such that every pair of elements in L has a least upper bound and a greatest lower bound. The least upper bound of a, b ∈ L is called the

17.1

join of a and b and is denoted by a ∨ b. The greatest lower bound of a, b ∈ L is called the meet of a and b and is denoted by a ∧ b. Example 7. Let X be a set. Then the power set of X, P(X), is a lattice. For two sets A and B in P(X), the least upper bound of A and B is A ∪ B. Certainly A ∪ B is an upper bound of A and B, since A ⊆ A ∪ B and B ⊆ A ∪ B. If C is some other set containing both A and B, then C must contain A ∪ B; hence, A ∪ B is the least upper bound of A and B. Similarly, the greatest lower bound of A and B is A ∩ B. Example 8. Let G be a group and suppose that X is the set of subgroups of G. Then X is a poset ordered by set-theoretic inclusion, ⊆. The set of subgroups of G is also a lattice. If H and K are subgroups of G, the greatest lower bound of H and K is H ∩ K. The set H ∪ K may not be a subgroup of G. We leave it as an exercise to show that the least upper bound of H and K is the subgroup generated by H ∪ K. In set theory we have certain duality conditions. For example, by De Morgan’s laws, any statement about sets that is true about (A ∪ B) must also be true about A ∩ B . We also have a duality principle for lattices. Principle of Duality. Any statement that is true for all lattices remains true when is replaced by and ∨ and ∧ are interchanged throughout the statement. The following theorem tells us that a lattice is an algebraic structure with two binary operations that satisfy certain axioms. Theorem 17.2 If L is a lattice, then the binary operations ∨ and ∧ satisfy the following properties for a, b, c ∈ L. 1. Commutative laws: a ∨ b = b ∨ a and a ∧ b = b ∧ a. 2. Associative laws: a ∨ (b ∨ c) = (a ∨ b) ∨ c and a ∧ (b ∧ c) = (a ∧ b) ∧ c. 3. Idempotent laws: a ∨ a = a and a ∧ a = a. 4. Absorption laws: a ∨ (a ∧ b) = a and a ∧ (a ∨ b) = a. Proof. By the Principle of Duality, we need only prove the ﬁrst statement in each part. (1) By deﬁnition a ∨ b is the least upper bound of {a, b}, and b ∨ a is the least upper bound of {b, a}; however, {a, b} = {b, a}.

298

CHAPTER 17

(2) We will show that a ∨ (b ∨ c) and (a ∨ b) ∨ c are both least upper bounds of {a, b, c}. Let d = a ∨ b. Then c d ∨ c = (a ∨ b) ∨ c. We also know that a a ∨ b = d d ∨ c = (a ∨ b) ∨ c. A similar argument demonstrates that b (a ∨ b) ∨ c. Therefore, (a ∨ b) ∨ c is an upper bound of {a, b, c}. We now need to show that (a ∨ b) ∨ c is the least upper bound of {a, b, c}. Let u be some other upper bound of {a, b, c}. Then a u and b u; hence, d = a ∨ b u. Since c u, it follows that (a ∨ b) ∨ c = d ∨ c u. Therefore, (a ∨ b) ∨ c must be the least upper bound of {a, b, c}. The argument that shows a ∨ (b ∨ c) is the least upper bound of {a, b, c} is the same. Consequently, a ∨ (b ∨ c) = (a ∨ b) ∨ c. (3) The join of a and a is the least upper bound of {a}; hence, a ∨ a = a. (4) Let d = a ∧ b. Then a a ∨ d. On the other hand, d = a ∧ b a, and so a ∨ d a. Therefore, a ∨ (a ∧ b) = a. Given any arbitrary set L with operations ∨ and ∧, satisfying the conditions of the previous theorem, it is natural to ask whether or not this set comes from some lattice. The following theorem says that this is always the case. Theorem 17.3 Let L be a nonempty set with two binary operations ∨ and ∧ satisfying the commutative, associative, idempotent, and absorption laws. We can deﬁne a partial order on L by a b if a ∨ b = b. Furthermore, L is a lattice with respect to if for all a, b ∈ L, we deﬁne the least upper bound and greatest lower bound of a and b by a ∨ b and a ∧ b, respectively. Proof. We ﬁrst show that L is a poset under . Since a ∨ a = a, a a and is reﬂexive. To show that is antisymmetric, let a b and b a. Then a ∨ b = b and b ∨ a = a. By the commutative law, b = a ∨ b = b ∨ a = a. Finally, we must show that is transitive. Let a b and b c. Then a ∨ b = b and b ∨ c = c. Thus, a ∨ c = a ∨ (b ∨ c) = (a ∨ b) ∨ c = b ∨ c = c, or a c. To show that L is a lattice, we must prove that a ∨ b and a ∧ b are, respectively, the least upper and greatest lower bounds of a and b. Since a = (a ∨ b) ∧ a = a ∧ (a ∨ b), it follows that a a ∨ b. Similarly, b a ∨ b. Therefore, a ∨ b is an upper bound for a and b. Let u be any other upper bound of both a and b. Then a u and b u. But a ∨ b u since (a ∨ b) ∨ u = a ∨ (b ∨ u) = a ∨ u = u.

The proof that a ∧ b is the greatest lower bound of a and b is left as an exercise.

17.2

Boolean Algebras

Let us investigate the example of the power set, P(X), of a set X more closely. The power set is a lattice that is ordered by inclusion. By the deﬁnition of the power set, the largest element in P(X) is X itself and the smallest element is ∅, the empty set. For any set A in P(X), we know that A ∩ X = A and A ∪ ∅ = A. This suggests the following deﬁnition for lattices. An element I in a poset X is a largest element if a I for all a ∈ X. An element O is a smallest element of X if O a for all a ∈ X. Let A be in P(X). Recall that the complement of A is A = X \ A = {x : x ∈ X and x ∈ A}. / We know that A ∪ A = X and A ∩ A = ∅. We can generalize this example for lattices. A lattice L with a largest element I and a smallest element O is complemented if for each a ∈ X, there exists an a such that a ∨ a = I and a ∧ a = O. In a lattice L, the binary operations ∨ and ∧ satisfy commutative and associative laws; however, they need not satisfy the distributive law a ∧ (b ∨ c) = (a ∧ b) ∨ (a ∧ c); however, in P(X) the distributive law is satisﬁed since A ∩ (B ∪ C) = (A ∩ B) ∪ (A ∩ C) for A, B, C ∈ P(X). We will say that a lattice L is distributive if the following distributive law holds: a ∧ (b ∨ c) = (a ∧ b) ∨ (a ∧ c) for all a, b, c ∈ L. Theorem 17.4 A lattice L is distributive if and only if a ∨ (b ∧ c) = (a ∨ b) ∧ (a ∨ c) for all a, b, c ∈ L.

CHAPTER 17

LATTICES AND BOOLEAN ALGEBRAS

Proof. Let us assume that L is a distributive lattice. a ∨ (b ∧ c) = [a ∨ (a ∧ c)] ∨ (b ∧ c) = a ∨ [(a ∧ c) ∨ (b ∧ c)] = a ∨ [(c ∧ a) ∨ (c ∧ b)] = a ∨ [c ∧ (a ∨ b)] = a ∨ [(a ∨ b) ∧ c] = [(a ∨ b) ∧ a] ∨ [(a ∨ b) ∧ c] = (a ∨ b) ∧ (a ∨ c). The converse follows directly from the Duality Principle. A Boolean algebra is a lattice B with a greatest element I and a smallest element O such that B is both distributive and complemented. The power set of X, P(X), is our prototype for a Boolean algebra. As it turns out, it is also one of the most important Boolean algebras. The following theorem allows us to characterize Boolean algebras in terms of the binary relations ∨ and ∧ without mention of the fact that a Boolean algebra is a poset. Theorem 17.5 A set B is a Boolean algebra if and only if there exist binary operations ∨ and ∧ on B satisfying the following axioms. 1. a ∨ b = b ∨ a and a ∧ b = b ∧ a for a, b ∈ B. 2. a ∨ (b ∨ c) = (a ∨ b) ∨ c and a ∧ (b ∧ c) = (a ∧ b) ∧ c for a, b, c ∈ B. 3. a ∧ (b ∨ c) = (a ∧ b) ∨ (a ∧ c) and a ∨ (b ∧ c) = (a ∨ b) ∧ (a ∨ c) for a, b, c ∈ B. 4. There exist elements I and O such that a ∨ O = a and a ∧ I = a for all a ∈ B. 5. For every a ∈ B there exists an a ∈ B such that a ∨ a = I and a ∧ a = O. Proof. Let B be a set satisfying (1)–(5) in the theorem. One of the idempotent laws is satisﬁed since a = a∨O = a ∨ (a ∧ a ) = (a ∨ a) ∧ (a ∨ a ) = (a ∨ a) ∧ I = a ∨ a.

Observe that I ∨ b = (I ∨ b) ∧ I = (I ∧ I) ∨ (b ∧ I) = I ∨ I = I. Consequently, the ﬁrst of the two absorption laws holds, since a ∨ (a ∧ b) = (a ∧ I) ∨ (a ∧ b) = a ∧ (I ∨ b) = a∧I = a. The other idempotent and absorption laws are proven similarly. Since B also satisﬁes (1)–(3), the conditions of Theorem 17.3 are met; therefore, B must be a lattice. Condition (4) tells us that B is a distributive lattice. For a ∈ B, O ∨ a = a; hence, O a and O is the smallest element in B. To show that I is the largest element in B, we will ﬁrst show that a ∨ b = b is equivalent to a ∧ b = a. Since a ∨ I = a for all a ∈ B, using the absorption laws we can determine that a ∨ I = (a ∧ I) ∨ I = I ∨ (I ∧ a) = I or a I for all a in B. Finally, since we know that B is complemented by (5), B must be a Boolean algebra. Conversely, suppose that B is a Boolean algebra. Let I and O be the greatest and least elements in B, respectively. If we deﬁne a ∨ b and a ∧ b as least upper and greatest lower bounds of {a, b}, then B is a Boolean algebra by Theorem 17.3, Theorem 17.4, and our hypothesis. Many other identities hold in Boolean algebras. Some of these identities are listed in the following theorem. Theorem 17.6 Let B be a Boolean algebra. Then 1. a ∨ I = I and a ∧ O = O for all a ∈ B. 2. If a ∨ b = a ∨ c and a ∧ b = a ∧ c for a, b, c ∈ B, then b = c. 3. If a ∨ b = I and a ∧ b = O, then b = a . 4. (a ) = a for all a ∈ B. 5. I = O and O = I. 6. (a ∨ b) = a ∧ b and (a ∧ b) = a ∨ b (De Morgan’s Laws).

Proof. We will prove only (2). The rest of the identities are left as exercises. For a ∨ b = a ∨ c and a ∧ b = a ∧ c, we have b = b ∨ (b ∧ a) = b ∨ (a ∧ b) = b ∨ (a ∧ c) = (b ∨ a) ∧ (b ∨ c) = (a ∨ b) ∧ (b ∨ c) = (a ∨ c) ∧ (b ∨ c) = (c ∨ a) ∧ (c ∨ b) = c ∨ (a ∧ b) = c ∨ (a ∧ c) = c ∨ (c ∧ a) = c.

Finite Boolean Algebras
A Boolean algebra is a ﬁnite Boolean algebra if it contains a ﬁnite number of elements as a set. Finite Boolean algebras are particularly nice since we can classify them up to isomorphism. Let B and C be Boolean algebras. A bijective map φ : B → C is an isomorphism of Boolean algebras if φ(a ∨ b) = φ(a) ∨ φ(b) φ(a ∧ b) = φ(a) ∧ φ(b) for all a and b in B. We will show that any ﬁnite Boolean algebra is isomorphic to the Boolean algebra obtained by taking the power set of some ﬁnite set X. We will need a few lemmas and deﬁnitions before we prove this result. Let B be a ﬁnite Boolean algebra. An element a ∈ B is an atom of B if a = O and a ∧ b = a for all b ∈ B. Equivalently, a is an atom of B if there is no nonzero b ∈ B distinct from a such that O b a. Lemma 17.7 Let B be a ﬁnite Boolean algebra. If b is a nonzero element of B, then there is an atom a in B such that a b.

17.2

BOOLEAN ALGEBRAS

303

Proof. If b is an atom, let a = b. Otherwise, choose an element b1 , not equal to O or b, such that b1 b. We are guaranteed that this is possible since b is not an atom. If b1 is an atom, then we are done. If not, choose b2 , not equal to O or b1 , such that b2 b1 . Again, if b2 is an atom, let a = b2 . Continuing this process, we can obtain a chain O ··· b3 b2 b1 b.

Since B is a ﬁnite Boolean algebra, this chain must be ﬁnite. That is, for some k, bk is an atom. Let a = bk . Lemma 17.8 Let a and b be atoms in a ﬁnite Boolean algebra B such that a = b. Then a ∧ b = O. Proof. Since a ∧ b is the greatest lower bound of a and b, we know that a ∧ b a. Hence, either a ∧ b = a or a ∧ b = O. However, if a ∧ b = a, then either a b or a = O. In either case we have a contradiction because a and b are both atoms; therefore, a ∧ b = O. Lemma 17.9 Let B be a Boolean algebra and a, b ∈ B. The following statements are equivalent. 1. a b.

2. a ∧ b = O. 3. a ∨ b = I. Proof. (1) ⇒ (2). If a b, then a ∨ b = b. Therefore, a∧b = a ∧ (a ∨ b) = a ∧ (a ∧ b ) = (a ∧ a ) ∧ b = O∧b = O. (2) ⇒ (3). If a ∧ b = O, then a ∨ b = (a ∧ b ) = O = I. (3) ⇒ (1). If a ∨ b = I, then a = a ∧ (a ∨ b) = (a ∧ a ) ∨ (a ∧ b) = O ∨ (a ∧ b) = a ∧ b. Thus, a b.

Lemma 17.10 Let B be a Boolean algebra and b and c be elements in B such that b c. Then there exists an atom a ∈ B such that a b and a c. Proof. By Lemma 17.9, b ∧ c = O. Hence, there exists an atom a such that a b ∧ c . Consequently, a b and a c. Lemma 17.11 Let b ∈ B and a1 , . . . , an be the atoms of B such that ai b. Then b = a1 ∨· · ·∨an . Furthermore, if a, a1 , . . . , an are atoms of B such that a b, ai b, and b = a ∨ a1 ∨ · · · ∨ an , then a = ai for some i = 1, . . . , n. Proof. Let b1 = a1 ∨ · · · ∨ an . Since ai b for each i, we know that b1 b. If we can show that b b1 , then the lemma is true by antisymmetry. Assume b b1 . Then there exists an atom a such that a b and a b1 . Since a is an atom and a b, we can deduce that a = ai for some ai . However, this is impossible since a b1 . Therefore, b b1 . Now suppose that b = a1 ∨ · · · ∨ an . If a is an atom less than b, a = a ∧ b = a ∧ (a1 ∨ · · · ∨ an ) = (a ∧ a1 ) ∨ · · · ∨ (a ∧ an ). But each term is O or a with a ∧ ai occurring for only one ai . Hence, by Lemma 17.8, a = ai for some i. Theorem 17.12 Let B be a ﬁnite Boolean algebra. Then there exists a set X such that B is isomorphic to P(X). Proof. We will show that B is isomorphic to P(X), where X is the set of atoms of B. Let a ∈ B. By Lemma 17.11, we can write a uniquely as a = a1 ∨ · · · ∨ an for a1 , . . . , an ∈ X. Consequently, we can deﬁne a map φ : B → P(X) by φ(a) = φ(a1 ∨ · · · ∨ an ) = {a1 , . . . , an }. Clearly, φ is onto. Now let a = a1 ∨· · ·∨an and b = b1 ∨· · ·∨bm be elements in B, where each ai and each bi is an atom. If φ(a) = φ(b), then {a1 , . . . , an } = {b1 , . . . , bm } and a = b. Consequently, φ is injective. The join of a and b is preserved by φ since φ(a ∨ b) = φ(a1 ∨ · · · ∨ an ∨ b1 ∨ · · · ∨ bm ) = {a1 , . . . , an , b1 , . . . , bm } = {a1 , . . . , an } ∪ {b1 , . . . , bm } = φ(a1 ∨ · · · ∨ an ) ∪ φ(b1 ∧ · · · ∨ bm ) = φ(a) ∪ φ(b).

Similarly, φ(a ∧ b) = φ(a) ∩ φ(b). We leave the proof of the following corollary as an exercise. Corollary 17.13 The order of any ﬁnite Boolean algebra must be 2n for some positive integer n.

17.3

The Algebra of Electrical Circuits

The usefulness of Boolean algebras has become increasingly apparent over the past several decades with the development of the modern computer. The circuit design of computer chips can be expressed in terms of Boolean algebras. In this section we will develop the Boolean algebra of electrical circuits and switches; however, these results can easily be generalized to the design of integrated computer circuitry. A switch is a device, located at some point in an electrical circuit, that controls the ﬂow of current through the circuit. Each switch has two possible states: it can be open, and not allow the passage of current through the circuit, or a it can be closed, and allow the passage of current. These states are mutually exclusive. We require that every switch be in one state or the other: a switch cannot be open and closed at the same time. Also, if one switch is always in the same state as another, we will denote both by the same letter; that is, two switches that are both labeled with the same letter a will always be open at the same time and closed at the same time. Given two switches, we can construct two fundamental types of circuits. Two switches a and b are in series if they make up a circuit of the type that is illustrated in Figure 17.3. Current can pass between the terminals A and B in a series circuit only if both of the switches a and b are closed. We will denote this combination of switches by a ∧ b. Two switches a and b are in parallel if they form a circuit of the type that appears in Figure 17.4. In the case of a parallel circuit, current can pass between A and B if either one of the switches is closed. We denote a parallel combination of circuits a and b by a ∨ b.

Figure 17.4. a ∨ b We can build more complicated electrical circuits out of series and parallel circuits by replacing any switch in the circuit with one of these two fundamental types of circuits. Circuits constructed in this manner are called series-parallel circuits. We will consider two circuits equivalent if they act the same. That is, if we set the switches in equivalent circuits exactly the same we will obtain the same result. For example, in a series circuit a ∧ b is exactly the same as b ∧ a. Notice that this is exactly the commutative law for Boolean algebras. In fact, the set of all series-parallel circuits forms a Boolean algebra under the operations of ∨ and ∧. We can use diagrams to verify the diﬀerent axioms of a Boolean algebra. The distributive law, a ∧ (b ∨ c) = (a ∧ b) ∨ (a ∧ c), is illustrated in Figure 17.5. If a is a switch, then a is the switch that is always open when a is closed and always closed when a is open. A circuit that is always closed is I in our algebra; a circuit that is always open is O. The laws for a ∧ a = O and a ∨ a = I are shown in Figure 17.6. b a c a c a b

For example, given the expression (a ∨ b) ∧ (a ∨ b ) ∧ (a ∨ b), we can construct the circuit in Figure 17.7. Theorem 17.14 The set of all circuits is a Boolean algebra. We leave as an exercise the proof of this theorem for the Boolean algebra axioms not yet veriﬁed. We can now apply the techniques of Boolean

Consider the circuit in Figure 17.7. Since (a ∨ b) ∧ (a ∨ b ) ∧ (a ∨ b) = (a ∨ b) ∧ (a ∨ b) ∧ (a ∨ b ) = (a ∨ b) ∧ (a ∨ b ) = a ∨ (b ∨ b ) = a, we can replace the more complicated circuit with a circuit containing the single switch a and achieve the same function. Historical Note
George Boole (1815–1864) was the ﬁrst person to study lattices. In 1847, he published The Investigation of the Laws of Thought, a book in which he used lattices to formalize logic and the calculus of propositions. Boole believed that mathematics was the study of form rather than of content; that is, he was not so much concerned with what he was calculating as with how he was calculating it. Boole’s work was carried on by his friend Augustus De Morgan (1806–1871). De Morgan observed that the principle of duality often held in set theory, as is illustrated by De Morgan’s laws for set theory. He believed, as did Boole, that mathematics was the study of symbols and abstract operations.

Set theory and logic were further advanced by such mathematicians as Alfred North Whitehead (1861–1947), Bertrand Russell (1872–1970), and David Hilbert (1862–1943). In Principia Mathematica, Whitehead and Russell attempted to show the connection between mathematics and logic by the deduction of the natural number system from the rules of formal logic. If the natural numbers could be determined from logic itself, then so could much of the rest of existing mathematics. Hilbert attempted to build up mathematics by using symbolic logic in a way that would prove the consistency of mathematics. His approach was dealt a mortal blow by Kurt G¨del (1906–1978), who proved that there will always be “undecidable” o problems in any suﬃciently rich axiomatic system; that is, that in any mathematical system of any consequence, there will always be statements that can never be proven either true or false. As often occurs, this basic research in pure mathematics later became indispensable in a wide variety of applications. Boolean algebras and logic have become essential in the design of the large-scale integrated circuitry found on today’s computer chips. Sociologists have used lattices and Boolean algebras to model social hierarchies; biologists have used them to describe biosystems.

Vector Spaces

In a physical system a quantity can often be described with a single number. For example, we need to know only a single number to describe temperature, mass, or volume. However, for some quantities, such as location, we need several numbers. To give the location of a point in space, we need x, y, and z coordinates. Temperature distribution over a solid object requires four numbers: three to identify each point within the object and a fourth to describe the temperature at that point. Often n-tuples of numbers, or vectors, also have certain algebraic properties, such as addition or scalar multiplication. In this chapter we will examine mathematical structures called vector spaces. As with groups and rings, it is desirable to give a simple list of axioms that must be satisﬁed to make a set of vectors a structure worth studying.

18.1

Deﬁnitions and Examples

A vector space V over a ﬁeld F is an abelian group with a scalar product α·v or αv deﬁned for all α ∈ F and all v ∈ V satisfying the following axioms. • α(βv) = (αβ)v; • (α + β)v = αv + βv; • α(u + v) = αu + αv; • 1v = v; where α, β ∈ F and u, v ∈ V . The elements of V are called vectors; the elements of F are called scalars. It is important to notice that in most cases two vectors cannot be 312

18.1

multiplied. In general, it is only possible to multiply a vector with a scalar. To diﬀerentiate between the scalar zero and the vector zero, we will write them as 0 and 0, respectively. Let us examine several examples of vector spaces. Some of them will be quite familiar; others will seem less so. Example 1. The n-tuples of real numbers, denoted by Rn , form a vector space over R. Given vectors u = (u1 , . . . , un ) and v = (v1 , . . . , vn ) in Rn and α in R, we can deﬁne vector addition by u + v = (u1 , . . . , un ) + (v1 , . . . , vn ) = (u1 + v1 , . . . , un + vn ) and scalar multiplication by αu = α(u1 , . . . , un ) = (αu1 , . . . , αun ).

Example 2. If F is a ﬁeld, then F [x] is a vector space over F . The vectors in F [x] are simply polynomials. Vector addition is just polynomial addition. If α ∈ F and p(x) ∈ F [x], then scalar multiplication is deﬁned by αp(x). Example 3. The set of all continuous real-valued functions on a closed interval [a, b] is a vector space over R. If f (x) and g(x) are continuous on [a, b], then (f + g)(x) is deﬁned to be f (x) + g(x). Scalar multiplication is deﬁned by (αf )(x) = αf (x) for α ∈ R. For example, if f (x) = sin x and g(x) = x2 , then (2f + 5g)(x) = 2 sin x + 5x2 . √ √ Example 4. Let V = Q( 2 ) = {a + b √ : a, b ∈ Q}. Then V is a vector 2 √ √ space over Q. If u = a+b 2 and v = c+d 2, then u+v = (a+c)+(b+d) 2 is again in V . Also, for α ∈ Q, αv is in V . We will leave it as an exercise to verify that all of the vector space axioms hold for V . Proposition 18.1 Let V be a vector space over F . Then each of the following statements is true. 1. 0v = 0 for all v ∈ V . 2. α0 = 0 for all α ∈ F . 3. If αv = 0, then either α = 0 or v = 0. 4. (−1)v = −v for all v ∈ V .

VECTOR SPACES

5. −(αv) = (−α)v = α(−v) for all α ∈ F and all v ∈ V . Proof. To prove (1), observe that 0v = (0 + 0)v = 0v + 0v; consequently, 0 + 0v = 0v + 0v. Since V is an abelian group, 0 = 0v. The proof of (2) is almost identical to the proof of (1). For (3), we are done if α = 0. Suppose that α = 0. Multiplying both sides of αv = 0 by 1/α, we have v = 0. To show (4), observe that v + (−1)v = 1v + (−1)v = (1 − 1)v = 0v = 0, and so −v = (−1)v. We will leave the proof of (5) as an exercise.

18.2

Subspaces

Just as groups have subgroups and rings have subrings, vector spaces also have substructures. Let V be a vector space over a ﬁeld F , and W a subset of V . Then W is a subspace of V if it is closed under vector addition and scalar multiplication; that is, if u, v ∈ W and α ∈ F , it will always be the case that u + v and αv are also in W . Example 5. Let W be the subspace of R3 deﬁned by W = {(x1 , 2x1 + x2 , x1 − x2 ) : x1 , x2 ∈ R}. We claim that W is a subspace of R3 . Since α(x1 , 2x1 + x2 , x1 − x2 ) = (αx1 , α(2x1 + x2 ), α(x1 − x2 )) = (αx1 , 2(αx1 ) + αx2 , αx1 − αx2 ), W is closed under scalar multiplication. To show that W is closed under vector addition, let u = (x1 , 2x1 + x2 , x1 − x2 ) and v = (y1 , 2y1 + y2 , y1 − y2 ) be vectors in W . Then u + v = (x1 + y1 , 2(x1 + y1 ) + (x2 + y2 ), (x1 + y1 ) − (x2 + y2 )).

Example 6. Let W be the subset of polynomials of F [x] with no oddpower terms. If p(x) and q(x) have no odd-power terms, then neither will p(x) + q(x). Also, αp(x) ∈ W for α ∈ F and p(x) ∈ W .

LINEAR INDEPENDENCE

Let V be any vector ﬁeld over a ﬁeld F and suppose that v1 , v2 , . . . , vn are vectors in V and α1 , α2 , . . . , αn are scalars in F . Any vector w in V of the form
n

w=
i=1

αi vi = α1 v1 + α2 v2 + · · · + αn vn

is called a linear combination of the vectors v1 , v2 , . . . , vn . The spanning set of vectors v1 , v2 , . . . , vn is the set of vectors obtained from all possible linear combinations of v1 , v2 , . . . , vn . If W is the spanning set of v1 , v2 , . . . , vn , then we often say that W is spanned by v1 , v2 , . . . , vn . Proposition 18.2 Let S = {v1 , v2 , . . . , vn } be vectors in a vector space V . Then the span of S is a subspace of V . Proof. Let u and v be in S. We can write both of these vectors as linear combinations of the vi ’s: u = α1 v1 + α2 v2 + · · · + αn vn v = β1 v1 + β2 v2 + · · · + βn vn . Then u + v = (α1 + β1 )v1 + (α2 + β2 )v2 + · · · + (αn + βn )vn is a linear combination of the vi ’s. For α ∈ F , αu = (αα1 )v1 + (αα2 )v2 + · · · + (ααn )vn is in the span of S.

18.3

Linear Independence

Let S = {v1 , v2 , . . . , vn } be a set of vectors in a vector space V . If there exist scalars α1 , α2 . . . αn ∈ F such that not all of the αi ’s are zero and α1 v1 + α2 v2 + · · · + αn vn = 0, then S is said to be linearly dependent. If the set S is not linearly dependent, then it is said to be linearly independent. More speciﬁcally, S is a linearly independent set if α1 v1 + α2 v2 + · · · + αn vn = 0 implies that α1 = α2 = · · · = αn = 0 for any set of scalars {α1 , α2 . . . αn }.

CHAPTER 18

Proposition 18.3 Let {v1 , v2 , . . . , vn } be a set of linearly independent vectors in a vector space. Suppose that v = α1 v1 + α2 v2 + · · · + αn vn = β1 v1 + β2 v2 + · · · + βn vn . Then α1 = β1 , α2 = β2 , . . . , αn = βn . Proof. If v = α1 v1 + α2 v2 + · · · + αn vn = β1 v1 + β2 v2 + · · · + βn vn , then (α1 − β1 )v1 + (α2 − β2 )v2 + · · · + (αn − βn )vn = 0. Since v1 , . . . , vn are linearly independent, αi − βi = 0 for i = 1, . . . , n. The deﬁnition of linear dependence makes more sense if we consider the following proposition. Proposition 18.4 A set {v1 , v2 , . . . , vn } of vectors in a vector space V is linearly dependent if and only if one of the vi ’s is a linear combination of the rest. Proof. Suppose that {v1 , v2 , . . . , vn } is a set of linearly dependent vectors. Then there exist scalars α1 , . . . , αn such that α1 v1 + α2 v2 + · · · + αn vn = 0, with at least one of the αi ’s not equal to zero. Suppose that αk = 0. Then vk = − α1 αk−1 αk+1 αn v1 − · · · − vk−1 − vk+1 − · · · − vn . αk αk αk αk

Conversely, suppose that vk = β1 v1 + · · · + βk−1 vk−1 + βk+1 vk+1 + · · · + βn vn . Then β1 v1 + · · · + βk−1 vk−1 − vk + βk+1 vk+1 + · · · + βn vn = 0.

The following proposition is a consequence of the fact that any system of homogeneous linear equations with more unknowns than equations will have a nontrivial solution. We leave the details of the proof for the end-of-chapter exercises.

LINEAR INDEPENDENCE

Proposition 18.5 Suppose that a vector space V is spanned by n vectors. If m > n, then any set of m vectors in V must be linearly dependent. A set {e1 , e2 , . . . , en } of vectors in a vector space V is called a basis for V if {e1 , e2 , . . . , en } is a linearly independent set that spans V . Example 7. The vectors e1 = (1, 0, 0), e2 = (0, 1, 0), and e3 = (0, 0, 1) form a basis for R3 . The set certainly spans R3 , since any arbitrary vector (x1 , x2 , x3 ) in R3 can be written as x1 e1 + x2 e2 + x3 e3 . Also, none of the vectors e1 , e2 , e3 can be written as a linear combination of the other two; hence, they are linearly independent. The vectors e1 , e2 , e3 are not the only basis of R3 : the set {(3, 2, 1), (3, 2, 0), (1, 1, 1)} is also a basis for R3 . √ √ √ Example 8.√Let Q( 2 ) = {a + b 2√ a, b ∈ Q}. The sets {1, 2 } and : √ {1 + 2, 1 − 2 } are both bases of Q( 2 ). From the last two examples it should be clear that a given vector space has several bases. In fact, there are an inﬁnite number of bases for both of these examples. In general, there is no unique basis for a vector space. However, every basis of R3 consists of exactly three vectors, and every basis √ of Q( 2 ) consists of exactly two vectors. This is a consequence of the next proposition. Proposition 18.6 Let {e1 , e2 , . . . , em } and {f1 , f2 , . . . , fn } be two bases for a vector space V . Then m = n. Proof. Since {e1 , e2 , . . . , em } is a basis, it is a linearly independent set. By Proposition 18.5, n ≤ m. Similarly, {f1 , f2 , . . . , fn } is a linearly independent set, and the last proposition implies that m ≤ n. Consequently, m = n. If {e1 , e2 , . . . , en } is a basis for a vector space V , then we say that the dimension of V is n and we write dim V = n. We will leave the proof of the following theorem as an exercise. Theorem 18.7 Let V be a vector space of dimension n. 1. If S = {v1 , . . . , vn } is a set of linearly independent vectors for V , then S is a basis for V . 2. If S = {v1 , . . . , vn } spans V , then S is a basis for V .

Fields

It is natural to ask whether or not some ﬁeld F is contained in a larger ﬁeld. We think of the rational numbers, which reside inside the real numbers, while in turn, the real numbers live inside the complex numbers. We can also study the ﬁelds between Q and R and inquire as to the nature of these ﬁelds. More speciﬁcally if we are given a ﬁeld F and a polynomial p(x) ∈ F [x], we can ask whether or not we can ﬁnd a ﬁeld E containing F such that p(x) factors into linear factors over E[x]. For example, if we consider the polynomial p(x) = x4 − 5x2 + 6 in Q[x], then p(x) factors as (x2 − 2)(x2 − 3). However, both of these factors are irreducible in Q[x]. If we wish to ﬁnd a zero of p(x), we must go to a larger ﬁeld. Certainly the ﬁeld of real numbers will work, since √ √ √ √ p(x) = (x − 2)(x + 2)(x − 3)(x + 3). It is possible to ﬁnd a smaller ﬁeld in which p(x) has a zero, namely √ √ Q( 2) = {a + b 2 : a, b ∈ Q}. We wish to be able to compute and study such ﬁelds for arbitrary polynomials over a ﬁeld F .

19.1

Extension Fields

A ﬁeld E is an extension ﬁeld of a ﬁeld F if F is a subﬁeld of E. The ﬁeld F is called the base ﬁeld. We write F ⊂ E. 322

19.1

EXTENSION FIELDS

323

Example 1. For example, let √ √ F = Q( 2 ) = {a + b 2 : a, b ∈ Q} √ √ and let E = Q( 2 + 3 ) be the smallest ﬁeld containing both Q and √ √ 2 + 3. Both E and F are extension ﬁelds of the rational numbers. We claim that E is an √ extension ﬁeld of F . √ see this, we need only show that To √ √ √ √ √ 2 is in E. Since 2 + 3 is in E, 1/( 2 + 3 ) =√ 3 −√ 2 must also be √ √ in √ E. Taking linear combinations of 2 + 3 and 3 − 2, we ﬁnd that √ 2 and 3 must both be in E. Example 2. Let p(x) = x2 + x + 1 ∈ Z2 [x]. Since neither 0 nor 1 is a root of this polynomial, we know that p(x) is irreducible over Z2 . We will construct a ﬁeld extension of Z2 containing an element α such that p(α) = 0. By Theorem 15.13, the ideal p(x) generated by p(x) is maximal; hence, Z2 [x]/ p(x) is a ﬁeld. Let f (x) + p(x) be an arbitrary element of Z2 [x]/ p(x) . By the division algorithm, f (x) = (x2 + x + 1)q(x) + r(x), where the degree of r(x) is less than the degree of x2 + x + 1. Therefore, f (x) + x2 + x + 1 = r(x) + x2 + x + 1 . The only possibilities for r(x) are then 0, 1, x, and 1 + x. Consequently, E = Z2 [x]/ x2 + x + 1 is a ﬁeld with four elements and must be a ﬁeld extension of Z2 , containing a zero α of p(x). The ﬁeld Z2 (α) consists of elements 0 + 0α = 0 1 + 0α = 1 0 + 1α = α 1 + 1α = 1 + α. Notice that α2 + α + 1 = 0; hence, if we compute (1 + α)2 , (1 + α)(1 + α) = 1 + α + α + (α)2 = α.

The following theorem, due to Kronecker, is so important and so basic to our understanding of ﬁelds that it is often known as the Fundamental Theorem of Field Theory. Theorem 19.1 Let F be a ﬁeld and let p(x) be a nonconstant polynomial in F [x]. Then there exists an extension ﬁeld E of F and an element α ∈ E such that p(α) = 0. Proof. To prove this theorem, we will employ the method that we used to construct Example 2. Clearly, we can assume that p(x) is an irreducible polynomial. We wish to ﬁnd an extension ﬁeld E of F containing an element α such that p(α) = 0. The ideal p(x) generated by p(x) is a maximal ideal in F [x] by Theorem 15.13; hence, F [x]/ p(x) is a ﬁeld. We claim that E = F [x]/ p(x) is the desired ﬁeld. We ﬁrst show that E is a ﬁeld extension of F . We can deﬁne a homomorphism of commutative rings by the map ψ : F → F [x]/ p(x) , where ψ(a) = a + p(x) for a ∈ F . It is easy to check that ψ is indeed a ring homomorphism. Observe that ψ(a) + ψ(b) = (a + p(x) ) + (b + p(x) ) = (a + b) + p(x) = ψ(a + b) and ψ(a)ψ(b) = (a + p(x) )(b + p(x) ) = ab + p(x) = ψ(ab). To prove that ψ is one-to-one, assume that a + p(x) = ψ(a) = ψ(b) = b + p(x) . Then a − b is a multiple of p(x), since it lives in the ideal p(x) . Since p(x) is a nonconstant polynomial, the only possibility is that a − b = 0. Consequently, a = b and ψ is injective. Since ψ is one-to-one, we can identify F with the subﬁeld {a + p(x) : a ∈ F } of E and view E as an extension ﬁeld of F .

It remains for us to prove that p(x) has a zero α ∈ F . Set α = x+ p(x) . Then α is in E. If p(x) = a0 + a1 x + · · · + an xn , then p(α) = a0 + a1 (x + p(x) ) + · · · + an (x + p(x) )n = a0 + (a1 x + p(x) ) + · · · + (an xn + p(x) ) = a0 + a1 x + · · · + an xn + p(x) = 0 + p(x) . Therefore, we have found an element α ∈ E = F [x]/ p(x) such that α is a zero of p(x). Example 3. Let p(x) = x5 + x4 + 1 ∈ Z2 [x]. Then p(x) has irreducible factors x2 + x + 1 and x3 + x + 1. For a ﬁeld extension E of Z2 such that p(x) has a root in E, we can let E be either Z2 [x]/ x2 +x+1 or Z2 [x]/ x3 +x+1 . We will leave it as an exercise to show that Z2 [x]/ x3 + x + 1 is a ﬁeld with 23 = 8 elements.

Algebraic Elements
An element α in an extension ﬁeld E over F is algebraic over F if f (α) = 0 for some nonzero polynomial f (x) ∈ F [x]. An element in E that is not algebraic over F is transcendental over F . An extension ﬁeld E of a ﬁeld F is an algebraic extension of F if every element in E is algebraic over F . If E is a ﬁeld extension of F and α1 , . . . , αn are contained in E, we denote the smallest ﬁeld containing F and α1 , . . . , αn by F (α1 , . . . , αn ). If E = F (α) for some α ∈ E, then E is a simple extension of F . √ Example 4. Both 2 and i are algebraic over Q since they are zeros of the polynomials x2 − 2 and x2 + 1, respectively. Clearly π and e are algebraic over the real numbers; however, it is a nontrivial fact that they are transcendental over Q. Numbers in R that are algebraic over Q are in fact quite rare. Almost all real numbers are transcendental over Q.1 (In many cases we do not know whether or not a particular number is transcendental; for example, it is not known whether π + e is transcendental or algebraic.) A complex number that is algebraic over Q is an algebraic number. A transcendental number is an element of C that is transcendental over Q.
1 If we choose a number in R, then there is a probability of 1 that the number will be transcendental over Q.

√ Example 5. We will show that 2 + 3 is algebraic over Q. If α = √ √ √ 2 + 3, then α2 = 2 + 3. Hence, α2 − 2 = 3 and (α2 − 2)2 = 3. Since α4 − 4α2 + 1 = 0, it must be true that α is a zero of the polynomial x4 − 4x2 + 1 ∈ Q[x]. It is very easy to give an example of an extension ﬁeld E over a ﬁeld F , where E contains an element transcendental over F . The following theorem characterizes transcendental extensions. Theorem 19.2 Let E be an extension ﬁeld of F and α ∈ E. Then α is transcendental over F if and only if F (α) is isomorphic to F (x), the ﬁeld of fractions of F [x]. Proof. Let φα : F [x] → E be the evaluation homomorphism for α. Then α is transcendental over F if and only if φα (p(x)) = p(α) = 0 for all nonconstant polynomials p(x) ∈ F [x]. This is true if and only if ker φα = {0}; that is, it is true exactly when φα is one-to-one. Hence, E must contain a copy of F [x]. The smallest ﬁeld containing F [x] is the ﬁeld of fractions F (x). By Theorem 16.4, E must contain a copy of this ﬁeld. We have a more interesting situation in the case of algebraic extensions. Theorem 19.3 Let E be an extension ﬁeld of a ﬁeld F and α ∈ E with α algebraic over F . Then there is a unique irreducible monic polynomial p(x) ∈ F [x] of smallest degree such that p(α) = 0. If f (x) is another monic polynomial in F [x] such that f (α) = 0, then p(x) divides f (x). Proof. Let φα : F [x] → E be the evaluation homomorphism. The kernel of φα is a principal ideal generated by some p(x) ∈ F [x] with deg p(x) ≥ 1. We know that such a polynomial exists, since F [x] is a principal ideal domain and α is algebraic. The ideal p(x) consists exactly of those elements of F [x] having α as a zero. If f (α) = 0 and f (x) is not the zero polynomial, then f (x) ∈ p(x) and p(x) divides f (x). So p(x) is a polynomial of minimal degree having α as a zero. Any other polynomial of the same degree having α as a zero must have the form βp(x) for some β ∈ F . Suppose now that p(x) = r(x)s(x) is a factorization of p into polynomials of lower degree. Since p(α) = 0, r(α)s(α) = 0; consequently, either r(α) = 0 or s(α) = 0, which contradicts the fact that p is of minimal degree. Therefore, p(x) must be irreducible. Let E be an extension ﬁeld of F and α ∈ E be algebraic over F . The unique monic polynomial p(x) of the last theorem is called the minimal polynomial for α over F . The degree of p(x) is the degree of α over F .

Example 6. Let f (x) = x2 − 2 and g(x) = x4 − 4x2 + 1. These polynomials √ √ are the minimal polynomials of 2 and 2 + 3, respectively. Proposition 19.4 Let E be a ﬁeld extension of F and α ∈ E be algebraic over F . Then F (α) ∼ F [x]/ p(x) , where p(x) is the minimal polynomial of = α over F . Proof. Let φα : F [x] → E be the evaluation homomorphism. The kernel of this map is the minimal polynomial p(x) of α. By the First Isomorphism Theorem for rings, the image of φα in E is isomorphic to F (α) since it contains both F and α. Theorem 19.5 Let E = F (α) be a simple extension of F , where α ∈ E is algebraic over F . Suppose that the degree of α over F is n. Then every element β ∈ E can be expressed uniquely in the form β = b0 + b1 α + · · · + bn−1 αn−1 for bi ∈ F . Proof. Since φα (F [x]) = F (α), every element in E = F (α) must be of the form φα (f (x)) = f (α), where f (α) is a polynomial in α with coeﬃcients in F . Let p(x) = xn + an−1 xn−1 + · · · + a0 be the minimal polynomial of α. Then p(α) = 0; hence, αn = −an−1 αn−1 − · · · − a0 . Similarly, αn+1 = ααn = −an−1 αn − an−2 αn−1 − · · · − a0 α = −an−1 (−an−1 αn−1 − · · · − a0 ) − an−2 αn−1 − · · · − a0 α. Continuing in this manner, we can express every monomial αm , m ≥ n, as a linear combination of powers of α that are less than n. Hence, any β ∈ F (α) can be written as β = b0 + b1 α + · · · + bn−1 αn−1 . To show uniqueness, suppose that β = b0 + b1 α + · · · + bn−1 αn−1 = c0 + c1 α + · · · + cn−1 αn−1

g(x) = (b0 − c0 ) + (b1 − c1 )x + · · · + (bn−1 − cn−1 )xn−1 is in F [x] and g(α) = 0. Since the degree of g(x) is less than the degree of p(x), the irreducible polynomial of α, g(x) must be the zero polynomial. Consequently, b0 − c0 = b1 − c1 = · · · = bn−1 − cn−1 = 0, or bi = ci for i = 0, 1, . . . , n − 1. Therefore, we have shown uniqueness. Example 7. Since x2 + 1 is irreducible over R, x2 + 1 is a maximal ideal in R[x]. So E = R[x]/ x2 + 1 is a ﬁeld extension of R that contains a root of x2 + 1. Let α = x + x2 + 1 . We can identify E with the complex numbers. By Theorem 19.4, E is isomorphic to R(α) = {a + bα : a, b ∈ R}. We know that α2 = −1 in E, since α2 + 1 = (x + x2 + 1 )2 + (1 + x2 + 1 ) = (x2 + 1) + x2 + 1 = 0. Hence, we have an isomorphism of R(α) with C deﬁned by the map that takes a + bα to a + bi. Let E be a ﬁeld extension of a ﬁeld F . If we regard E as a vector space over F , then we can bring the machinery of linear algebra to bear on the problems that we will encounter in our study of ﬁelds. The elements in the ﬁeld E are vectors; the elements in the ﬁeld F are scalars. We can think of addition in E as adding vectors. When we multiply an element in E by an element of F , we are multiplying a vector by a scalar. This view of ﬁeld extensions is especially fruitful if a ﬁeld extension E of F is a ﬁnite dimensional vector space over F , and Theorem 19.5 states that E = F (α) is ﬁnite dimensional vector space over F with basis {1, α, α2 , . . . , αn−1 }. If an extension ﬁeld E of a ﬁeld F is a ﬁnite dimensional vector space over F of dimension n, then we say that E is a ﬁnite extension of degree n over F . We write [E : F ] = n. to indicate the dimension of E over F . Theorem 19.6 Every ﬁnite extension ﬁeld E of a ﬁeld F is an algebraic extension.

Proof. Let α ∈ E. Since [E : F ] = n, the elements 1, α, . . . , αn cannot be linearly independent. Hence, there exist ai ∈ F , not all zero, such that an αn + an−1 αn−1 + · · · + a1 α + a0 = 0. Therefore, p(x) = an xn + · · · + a0 ∈ F [x] is a nonzero polynomial with p(α) = 0. Remark. Theorem 19.6 says that every ﬁnite extension of a ﬁeld F is an algebraic extension. The converse is false, however. We will leave it as an exercise to show that the set of all elements in R that are algebraic over Q forms an inﬁnite ﬁeld extension of Q. The next theorem is a counting theorem, similar to Lagrange’s Theorem in group theory. Theorem 19.6 will prove to be an extremely useful tool in our investigation of ﬁnite ﬁeld extensions. Theorem 19.7 If E is a ﬁnite extension of F and K is a ﬁnite extension of E, then K is a ﬁnite extension of F and [K : F ] = [K : E][E : F ]. Proof. Let {α1 , . . . , αn } be a basis for E as a vector space over F and {β1 , . . . , βm } be a basis for K as a vector space over E. We claim that {αi βj } is a basis for K over F . We will ﬁrst show that these vectors span K. Let u ∈ K. Then u = m bj βj and bj = n aij αi , where bj ∈ E j=1 i=1 and aij ∈ F . Then

Corollary 19.9 Let E be an extension ﬁeld of F . If α ∈ E is algebraic over F with minimal polynomial p(x) and β ∈ F (α) with minimal polynomial q(x), then deg q(x) divides deg p(x). Proof. We know that deg p(x) = [F (α) : F ] and deg q(x) = [F (β) : F ]. Since F ⊂ F (β) ⊂ F (α), [F (α) : F ] = [F (α) : F (β)][F (β) : F ]. √ √ Example 8. Let us determine an extension ﬁeld of Q containing 3+ 5. It √ √ is easy to determine that the minimal polynomial of 3 + 5 is x4 − 16x + 4.

This example shows that it is possible that some extension F (α1 , . . . , αn ) is actually a simple extension of F even though n > 1. √ √ √ Example 9.

We can show that this polynomial is irreducible over Q using Eisenstein’s Criterion, where we let p = 5. Consequently, √ √ √ 6 3 Q ⊂ Q( 5 ) ⊂ Q( 5, 5 i). √ √ √ But it must be the case that Q( 6 5 i) = Q( 3 5, 5 i), since the degree of both of these extensions is 6. Theorem 19.10 Let E be a ﬁeld extension of F . Then the following statements are equivalent. 1. E is a ﬁnite extension of F . 2. There exists a ﬁnite number of algebraic elements α1 , . . . , αn ∈ E such that E = F (α1 , . . . , αn ). 3. There exists a sequence of ﬁelds E = F (α1 , . . . , αn ) ⊃ F (α1 , . . . , αn−1 ) ⊃ · · · ⊃ F (α1 ) ⊃ F, where each ﬁeld F (α1 , . . . , αi ) is algebraic over F (α1 , . . . , αi−1 ). Proof.

where each ﬁeld F (α1 , . . . , αi ) is algebraic over F (α1 , . . . , αi−1 ). (3) ⇒ (1).

Since F (α1 , . . . , αi ) = F (α1 , . . . , αi−1 )(αi ) is simple extension and αi is algebraic over F (α1 , . . . , αi−1 ), it follows that [F (α1 , . . . , αi ) : F (α1 , . . . , αi−1 )] is ﬁnite for each i. Therefore, [E : F ] is ﬁnite.

Algebraic Closure
Given a ﬁeld F , the question arises as to whether or not we can ﬁnd a ﬁeld E such that every polynomial p(x) has a root in E. This leads us to the following theorem. Theorem 19.11 Let E be an extension ﬁeld of F . The set of elements in E that are algebraic over F form a ﬁeld. Proof. Let α, β ∈ E be algebraic over F . Then F (α, β) is a ﬁnite extension of F . Since every element of F (α, β) is algebraic over F , α ± β, α/β, and α/β (β = 0) are all algebraic over F . Consequently, the set of elements in E that are algebraic over F forms a ﬁeld. Corollary 19.12 The set of all algebraic numbers forms a ﬁeld; that is, the set of all complex numbers that are algebraic over Q makes up a ﬁeld. Let E be a ﬁeld extension of a ﬁeld F . We deﬁne the algebraic closure of a ﬁeld F in E to be the ﬁeld consisting of all elements in E that are algebraic over F . A ﬁeld F is algebraically closed if every nonconstant polynomial in F [x] has a root in F . Theorem 19.13 A ﬁeld F is algebraically closed if and only if every nonconstant polynomial in F [x] factors into linear factors over F [x].

SPLITTING FIELDS

333

Proof. Let F be an algebraically closed ﬁeld. If p(x) ∈ F [x] is a nonconstant polynomial, then p(x) has a zero in F , say α. Therefore, x−α must be a factor of p(x) and so p(x) = (x − α)q1 (x), where deg q1 (x) = deg p(x) − 1. Continue this process with q1 (x) to ﬁnd a factorization p(x) = (x − α)(x − β)q2 (x), where deg q2 (x) = deg p(x) − 2. The process must eventually stop since the degree of p(x) is ﬁnite. Conversely, suppose that every nonconstant polynomial p(x) in F [x] factors into linear factors. Let ax − b be such a factor. Then p(b/a) = 0. Consequently, F is algebraically closed. Corollary 19.14 An algebraically closed ﬁeld F has no proper algebraic extension E. Proof. Let E be an algebraic extension of F ; then F ⊂ E. For α ∈ E, the minimal polynomial of α is x − α. Therefore, α ∈ F and F = E. Theorem 19.15 Every ﬁeld F has a unique algebraic closure. It is a nontrivial fact that every ﬁeld has a unique algebraic closure. The proof is not extremely diﬃcult, but requires some rather sophisticated set theory. We refer the reader to [3], [4], or [7] for a proof of this result. We now state the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, ﬁrst proven by Gauss at the age of 22 in his doctoral thesis. This theorem states that every polynomial with coeﬃcients in the complex numbers has a root in the complex numbers. The proof of this theorem will be given in Chapter 21. Theorem 19.16 (Fundamental Theorem of Algebra) The ﬁeld of complex numbers is algebraically closed.

Let F be a ﬁeld and p(x) be a nonconstant polynomial in F [x]. We already know that we can ﬁnd a ﬁeld extension of F that contains a root of p(x). However, we would like to know whether an extension E of F containing all of the roots of p(x) exists. In other words, can we ﬁnd a ﬁeld extension of F such that p(x) factors into a product of linear polynomials? What is the “smallest” extension containing all the roots of p(x)?

CHAPTER 19

FIELDS

Let F be a ﬁeld and p(x) = a0 + a1 x + · · · + an xn be a nonconstant polynomial in F [x]. An extension ﬁeld E of F is a splitting ﬁeld of p(x) if there exist elements α1 , . . . , αn in E such that E = F (α1 , . . . , αn ) and p(x) = (x − α1 )(x − α2 ) · · · (x − αn ). A polynomial p(x) ∈ F [x] splits in E if it is the product of linear factors in E[x]. Example 10. Let p(x) = x4 + 2x2 − 8 be in Q[x]. Then p(x) has irreducible √ factors x2 − 2 and x2 + 4. Therefore, the ﬁeld Q( 2, i) is a splitting ﬁeld for p(x). Example 11. Let p(x) = x3 − 3 be in Q[x]. Then p(x) has a root in the √ ﬁeld Q( 3 3 ). However, this ﬁeld is not a splitting ﬁeld for p(x) since the complex cube roots of 3, √ √ − 3 3 ± ( 6 3 )5 i , 2 √ are not in Q( 3 3 ). Theorem 19.17 Let p(x) ∈ F [x] be a nonconstant polynomial. Then there exists a splitting ﬁeld E for p(x). Proof. We will use mathematical induction on the degree of p(x). If deg p(x) = 1, then p(x) is a linear polynomial and E = F . Assume that the theorem is true for all polynomials of degree k with 1 ≤ k < n and let deg p(x) = n. We can assume that p(x) is irreducible; otherwise, by our induction hypothesis, we are done. By Theorem 19.1, there exists a ﬁeld K such that p(x) has a zero α1 in K. Hence, p(x) = (x − α1 )q(x), where q(x) ∈ K[x]. Since deg q(x) = n − 1, there exists a splitting ﬁeld E ⊃ K of q(x) that contains the zeros α2 , . . . , αn of p(x) by our induction hypothesis. Consequently, E = K(α2 , . . . , αn ) = F (α1 , . . . , αn ) is a splitting ﬁeld of p(x). The question of uniqueness now arises for splitting ﬁelds. This question is answered in the aﬃrmative. Given two splitting ﬁelds K and L of a polynomial p(x) ∈ F [x], there exists a ﬁeld isomorphism φ : K → L that preserves F . In order to prove this result, we must ﬁrst prove a lemma.

Lemma 19.18 Let φ : E → F be an isomorphism of ﬁelds. Let K be an extension ﬁeld of E and α ∈ K be algebraic over E with minimal polynomial p(x). Suppose that L is an extension ﬁeld of F such that β is root of the polynomial in F [x] obtained from p(x) under the image of φ. Then φ extends to a unique isomorphism ψ : E(α) → F (β) such that ψ(α) = β and ψ agrees with φ on E. Proof. If p(x) has degree n, then by Theorem 19.5 we can write any element in E(α) as a linear combination of 1, α, . . . , αn−1 . Therefore, the isomorphism that we are seeking must be ψ(a0 + a1 α + · · · + an−1 αn−1 ) = φ(a0 ) + φ(a1 )β + · · · + φ(an−1 )β n−1 , where a0 + a1 α + · · · + an−1 αn−1 is an element in E(α). The fact that ψ is an isomorphism could be checked by direct computation; however, it is easier to observe that ψ is a composition of maps that we already know to be isomorphisms. We can extend φ to be an isomorphism from E[x] to F [x], which we will also denote by φ, by letting φ(a0 + a1 x + · · · + an xn ) = φ(a0 ) + φ(a1 )x + · · · + φ(an )xn . This extension agrees with the original isomorphism φ : E → F , since constant polynomials get mapped to constant polynomials. By assumption, φ(p(x)) = q(x); hence, φ maps p(x) onto q(x) . Consequently, we have an isomorphism φ : E[x]/ p(x) → F [x]/ q(x) . By Theorem 19.4, we have isomorphisms σ : E[x]/ p(x) → F (α) and τ : F [x]/ q(x) → F (β), deﬁned by evaluation at α and β, respectively. Therefore, ψ = τ −1 φσ is the required isomorphism.

Theorem 19.19 Let φ : E → F be an isomorphism of ﬁelds and let p(x) be a nonconstant polynomial in E[x] and q(x) the corresponding polynomial in F [x] under the isomorphism.

We can assume that p(x) is irreducible over E. Therefore, q(x) is also irreducible over F . If deg p(x) = 1, then by the deﬁnition of a splitting ﬁeld, K = E and L = F and there is nothing to prove. Assume that the theorem holds for all polynomials of degree less than n. Since K is a splitting ﬁeld of E, all of the roots of p(x) are in K. Choose one of these roots, say α, such that E ⊂ E(α) ⊂ K.

Now write p(x) = (x − α)f (x) and q(x) = (x − β)g(x), where the degrees of f (x) and g(x) are less than the degrees of p(x) and q(x), respectively. The ﬁeld extension K is a splitting ﬁeld for f (x) over E(α), and L is a splitting ﬁeld for g(x) over F (β). By our induction hypothesis there exists an isomorphism ψ : K → L such that ψ agrees with φ on E(α). Hence, there exists an isomorphism ψ : K → L such that ψ agrees with φ on E. Corollary 19.20 Let p(x) be a polynomial in F [x]. Then there exists a splitting ﬁeld K of p(x) that is unique up to isomorphism.

Geometric Constructions

In ancient Greece, three classic problems were posed. These problems are geometric in nature and involve straightedge-and-compass constructions from what is now high school geometry; that is, we are allowed to use only a straightedge and compass to solve them. The problems can be stated as follows.

1. Given an arbitrary angle, can one trisect the angle into three equal subangles using only a straightedge and compass? 2. Given an arbitrary circle, can one construct a square with the same area using only a straightedge and compass? 3. Given a cube, can one construct the edge of another cube having twice the volume of the original? Again, we are only allowed to use a straightedge and compass to do the construction. After puzzling mathematicians for over two thousand years, each of these constructions was ﬁnally shown to be impossible. We will use the theory of ﬁelds to provide a proof that the solutions do not exist. It is quite remarkable that the long-sought solution to each of these three geometric problems came from abstract algebra. First, let us determine more speciﬁcally what we mean by a straightedge and compass, and also examine the nature of these problems in a bit more depth. To begin with, a straightedge is not a ruler. We cannot measure arbitrary lengths with a straightedge. It is merely a tool for drawing a line through two points. The statement that the trisection of an arbitrary angle is impossible means that there is at least one angle that is impossible to trisect with a straightedge-and-compass construction. Certainly it is possible to trisect an angle in special cases. We can construct a 30◦ angle; hence, it is possible to trisect a 90◦ angle. However, we will show that it is impossible to construct a 20◦ angle. Therefore, we cannot trisect a 60◦ angle.

Constructible Numbers
A real number α is constructible if we can construct a line segment of length |α| in a ﬁnite number of steps from a segment of unit length by using a straightedge and compass. Theorem 19.21 The set of all constructible real numbers forms a subﬁeld F of the ﬁeld of real numbers. Proof. Let α and β be constructible numbers. We must show that α + β, α − β, αβ, and α/β (β = 0) are also constructible numbers. We can assume that both α and β are positive with α > β. It is quite obvious how to construct α+β and α−β. To ﬁnd a line segment with length αβ, we assume that β > 1 and construct the triangle in Figure 19.1 such that triangles ABC and ADE are similar. Since α/1 = x/β, the line segment x has

length αβ. A similar construction can be made if β < 1. We will leave it as an exercise to show that the same triangle can be used to construct α/β for β = 0.

1. If a line contains two points in F , then it has the equation ax+by+c = 0, where a, b, and c are in F . 2. If a circle has a center at a point with coordinates in F and a radius that is also in F , then it has the equation x2 + y 2 + dx + ey + f = 0, where d, e, and f are in F . Proof. Let (x1 , y1 ) and (x2 , y2 ) be points on a line whose coordinates are in F . If x1 = x2 , then the equation of the line through the two points is x−x1 = 0, which has the form ax+by +c = 0. If x1 = x2 , then the equation of the line through the two points is given by y − y1 = y2 − y1 x2 − x1 (x − x1 ),

which can also be put into the proper form. To prove the second part of the lemma, suppose that (x1 , y1 ) is the center of a circle of radius r. Then the circle has the equation (x − x1 )2 + (y − y1 )2 − r2 = 0. This equation can easily be put into the appropriate form. Starting with a ﬁeld of constructible numbers F , we have three possible ways of constructing additional points in R with a compass and straightedge. 1. To ﬁnd possible new points in R, we can take the intersection of two lines, each of which passes through two known points with coordinates in F . 2. The intersection of a line that passes through two points that have coordinates in F and a circle whose center has coordinates in F with radius of a length in F will give new points in R. 3. We can obtain new points in R by intersecting two circles whose centers have coordinates in F and whose radii are of lengths in F . The ﬁrst case gives no new points in R, since the solution of two equations of the form ax + by + c = 0 having coeﬃcients in F will always be in F . The third case can be reduced to the second case. Let x2 + y 2 + d1 x + e1 x + f1 = 0 x2 + y 2 + d2 x + e2 x + f2 = 0

be the equations of two circles, where di , ei , and fi are in F for i = 1, 2. These circles have the same intersection as the circle x2 + y 2 + d1 x + e1 x + f1 = 0 and the line (d1 − d2 )x + b(e2 − e1 )y + (f2 − f1 ) = 0. The last equation is that of the chord passing through the intersection points of the two circles. Hence, the intersection of two circles can be reduced to the case of an intersection of a line with a circle. Considering the case of the intersection of a line and a circle, we must determine the nature of the solutions of the equations ax + by + c = 0 x + y + dx + ey + f

If we eliminate y from these equations, we obtain an equation of the form Ax2 + Bx + C = 0, where A, B, and C are in F . The x coordinate of the intersection points is given by √ −B ± B 2 − 4AC x= 2A √ 2 − 4AC > 0. We have proven the following and is in F ( α ), where α = B lemma. Lemma 19.24 Let F be a ﬁeld of constructible numbers. Then the points determined by the intersections of lines and circles in F lie in the ﬁeld √ F ( α ) for some α in F . Theorem 19.25 A real number α is a constructible number if and only if there exists a sequence of ﬁelds Q = F0 ⊂ F1 ⊂ · · · ⊂ Fk √ such that Fi = Fi−1 ( αi ) with α ∈ Fk . In particular, there exists an integer k > 0 such that [Q(α) : Q] = 2k . Proof. The existence of the Fi ’s and the αi ’s is a direct consequence of Lemma 19.24 and of the fact that [Fk : Q] = [Fk : Fk−1 ][Fk−1 : Fk−2 ] · · · [F1 : Q] = 2k .

Corollary 19.26 The ﬁeld of all constructible numbers is an algebraic extension of Q. As we can see by the ﬁeld of constructible numbers, not every algebraic extension of a ﬁeld is a ﬁnite extension.

Doubling the Cube and Squaring the Circle
We are now ready to investigate the classical problems of doubling the cube and squaring the circle. We can use the ﬁeld of constructible numbers to show exactly when a particular geometric construction can be accomplished. Doubling the cube is impossible. Given the edge of the cube, it is impossible to construct with a straightedge and compass the edge of the cube that has twice the volume of the original cube. Let the original cube have an edge of length 1 and, therefore, a volume of 1. If we could construct a cube √ having a volume of 2, then this new cube would have an edge of length 3 2. √ However, 3 2 is a zero of the irreducible polynomial x3 − 2 over Q; hence, √ 3 [Q( 2 ) : Q] = 3 This is impossible, since 3 is not a power of 2. Squaring the circle is impossible. Suppose that we have a circle of radius 1. The area of the circle is π; therefore, we must be able to construct a √ √ square with side π. This is impossible since π and consequently π are both transcendental. Therefore, using a straightedge and compass, it is not possible to construct a square with the same area as the circle.

Trisecting an Angle
Trisecting an arbitrary angle is impossible. We will show that it is impossible to construct a 20◦ angle. Consequently, a 60◦ angle cannot be trisected. We ﬁrst need to calculate the triple-angle formula for the cosine: cos 3θ = cos(2θ + θ) = cos 2θ cos θ − sin 2θ sin θ = (2 cos2 θ − 1) cos θ − 2 sin2 θ cos θ = (2 cos2 θ − 1) cos θ − 2(1 − cos2 θ) cos θ = 4 cos3 θ − 3 cos θ. The angle θ can be constructed if and only if α = cos θ is constructible. Let θ = 20◦ . Then cos 3θ = cos 60◦ = 1/2. By the triple-angle formula for the

342 cosine, 1 4α3 − 3α = . 2

CHAPTER 19

Therefore, α is a zero of 8x3 −6x−1. This polynomial has no factors in Z[x], and hence is irreducible over Q[x]. Thus, [Q(α) : Q] = 3. Consequently, α cannot be a constructible number. Historical Note
Algebraic number theory uses the tools of algebra to solve problems in number theory. Modern algebraic number theory began with Pierre de Fermat (1601–1665). Certainly we can ﬁnd many positive integers that satisfy the equation x2 + y 2 = z 2 ; Fermat conjectured that the equation xn +y n = z n has no positive integer solutions for n ≥ 3. He stated in the margin of his copy of the Latin translation of Diophantus’ Arithmetica that he had found a marvelous proof of this theorem, but that the margin of the book was too narrow to contain it. To date, no one has been able to construct a proof, although the statement has been veriﬁed for all n less than or equal to 4 million. This conjecture is known as Fermat’s Last Theorem. Attempts to prove Fermat’s Last Theorem have led to important contributions to algebraic number theory by such notable mathematicians as Leonhard Euler (1707–1783). Signiﬁcant advances in the understanding of Fermat’s Last Theorem were made by Ernst Kummer (1810–1893). Kummer’s student, Leopold Kronecker (1823–1891), became one of the leading algebraists of the nineteenth century. Kronecker’s theory of ideals and his study of algebraic number theory added much to the understanding of ﬁelds. David Hilbert (1862–1943) and Hermann Minkowski (1864–1909) were among the mathematicians who led the way in this subject at the beginning of the twentieth century. Hilbert and Minkowski were both mathematicians at G¨ttingen University o in Germany. G¨ttingen was truly one the most important centers of mathematical o research during the last two centuries. The large number of exceptional mathematicians who studied there included Gauss, Dirichlet, Riemann, Dedekind, Noether, and Weyl. Andr´ Weil answered questions in number theory using algebraic geometry, a e ﬁeld of mathematics that studies geometry by studying commutative rings. From about 1955 to 1970, A. Grothendieck dominated the ﬁeld of algebraic geometry. Pierre Deligne, a student of Grothendieck, solved several of Weil’s number-theoretic conjectures. One of the most recent contributions to algebra and number theory is Gerd Falting’s proof of the Mordell-Weil conjecture. This conjecture of Mordell and Weil essentially says that certain polynomials p(x, y) in Z[x, y] have only a ﬁnite number of integral solutions.

Finite Fields

Finite ﬁelds appear in many applications of algebra, including coding theory and cryptography. We already know one ﬁnite ﬁeld, Zp , where p is prime. In this chapter we will show that a unique ﬁnite ﬁeld of order pn exists for every prime p, where n is a positive integer. Finite ﬁelds are also called Galois ´ ﬁelds in honor of Evariste Galois, who was one of the ﬁrst mathematicians to investigate them.

20.1

Structure of a Finite Field

Recall that a ﬁeld F has characteristic p if p is the smallest positive integer such that for every nonzero element α in F , we have pα = 0. If no such integer exists, then F has characteristic 0. From Theorem 14.5 we know that p must be prime. Suppose that F is a ﬁnite ﬁeld with n elements. Then nα = 0 for all α in F . Consequently, the characteristic of F must be p, where p is a prime dividing n. This discussion is summarized in the following proposition. Proposition 20.1 If F is a ﬁnite ﬁeld, then the characteristic of F is p, where p is prime. Throughout this chapter we will assume that p is a prime number unless otherwise stated. Proposition 20.2 If F is a ﬁnite ﬁeld of characteristic p, then the order of F is pn for some n ∈ N. Proof. Let φ : Z → F be the ring homomorphism deﬁned by φ(n) = n · 1. Since the characteristic of F is p, the kernel of φ must be pZ and the image of 346

φ must be a subﬁeld of F isomorphic to Zp . We will denote this subﬁeld by K. Since F is a ﬁnite ﬁeld, it must be a ﬁnite extension of K and, therefore, an algebraic extension of K. Suppose that [F : K] = n is the dimension of F , where F is a K vector space. There must exist elements α1 , . . . , αn ∈ F such that any element α in F can be written uniquely in the form α = a1 α1 + · · · + an αn , where the ai ’s are in K. Since there are p elements in K, there are pn possible linear combinations of the αi ’s. Therefore, the order of F must be pn . Lemma 20.3 (Freshman’s Dream) Let p be prime and D be an integral domain of characteristic p. Then ap + bp = (a + b)p for all positive integers n. Proof. We will prove this lemma using mathematical induction on n. We can use the binomial formula (see Chapter 1, Example 3) to verify the case for n = 1; that is, p p p (a + b) = ak bp−k . k

If 0 < k < p, then p k = p! k!(p − k)!

must be divisible by p, since p cannot divide k!(p − k)!. Note that D is an integral domain of characteristic p, so all but the ﬁrst and last terms in the sum must be zero. Therefore, (a + b)p = ap + bp . Now suppose that the result holds for all k, where 1 ≤ k ≤ n. By the induction hypothesis, (a + b)p

Therefore, the lemma is true for n + 1 and the proof is complete. Let F be a ﬁeld. A polynomial f (x) ∈ F [x] of degree n is separable if it has n distinct roots in the splitting ﬁeld of f (x); that is, f (x) is separable when it factors into distinct linear factors over the splitting ﬁeld of F .

extension E of F is a separable extension of F if every element in E is the root of a separable polynomial in F [x]. Example 1. The polynomial x2 − 2 is separable over Q since it factors √ √ √ as (x − 2 )(x + 2 ). In fact, Q( 2 ) is a separable extension of Q. Let √ α = a + b 2 be any element in Q. If b = 0, then α is a root of x − a. If b = 0, then α is the root of the separable polynomial √ √ x2 − 2ax + a2 − 2b2 = (x − (a + b 2 ))(x − (a − b 2 )).

Fortunately, we have an easy test to determine the separability of any polynomial. Let f (x) = a0 + a1 x + · · · + an xn be any polynomial in F [x]. Deﬁne the derivative of f (x) to be f (x) = a1 + 2a2 x + · · · + nan xn−1 . Lemma 20.4 Let F be a ﬁeld and f (x) ∈ F [x]. Then f (x) is separable if and only if f (x) and f (x) are relatively prime. Proof. Let f (x) be separable. Then f (x) factors over some extension ﬁeld of F as f (x) = (x − α1 )(x − α2 ) · · · (x − αn ), where αi = αj for i = j. Taking the derivative of f (x), we see that f (x) = (x − α2 ) · · · (x − αn ) + (x − α1 )(x − α3 ) · · · (x − αn ) + · · · + (x − α1 ) · · · (x − αn−1 ). Hence, f (x) and f (x) can have no common factors. To prove the converse, we will show that the contrapositive of the statement is true. Suppose that f (x) = (x − α)k g(x), where k > 1. Diﬀerentiating, we have f (x) = k(x − α)k−1 g(x) + (x − α)k g (x). Therefore, f (x) and f (x) have a common factor. Theorem 20.5 For every prime p and every positive integer n, there exists a ﬁnite ﬁeld F with pn elements. Furthermore, any ﬁeld of order pn is n isomorphic to the splitting ﬁeld of xp − x over Zp .

Proof. Let f (x) = xp − x and let F be the splitting ﬁeld of f (x). Then by n Lemma 20.4, f (x) has pn distinct zeros in F , since f (x) = pn xp −1 −1 = −1 is relatively prime to f (x). We claim that the roots of f (x) form a subﬁeld of F . Certainly 0 and 1 are zeros of f (x). If α and β are zeros of f (x), n n n then α + β and αβ are also zeros of f (x), since αp + β p = (α + β)p n pn n and αp β = (αβ)p . We also need to show that the additive inverse and the multiplicative inverse of each root of f (x) are roots of f (x). For any zero α of f (x), −α = (p − 1)α is also a zero of f (x). If α = 0, then n n (α−1 )p = (αp )−1 = α−1 . Since the zeros of f (x) form a subﬁeld of F and f (x) splits in this subﬁeld, the subﬁeld must be all of F . Let E be any other ﬁeld of order pn . To show that E is isomorphic to F , we must show that every element in E is a root of f (x). Certainly 0 is a root of f (x). Let α be a nonzero element of E. The order of the n multiplicative group of nonzero elements of E is pn − 1; hence, αp −1 = 1 n or αp − α = 0. Since E contains pn elements, E must be a splitting ﬁeld of f (x); however, by Corollary 19.20, the splitting ﬁeld of any polynomial is unique up to isomorphism. The unique ﬁnite ﬁeld with pn elements is called the Galois ﬁeld of order pn . We will denote this ﬁeld by GF(pn ). Theorem 20.6 Every subﬁeld of the Galois ﬁeld GF(pn ) has pm elements, where m divides n. Conversely, if m | n for m > 0, then there exists a unique subﬁeld of GF(pn ) isomorphic to GF(pm ). Proof. Let F be a subﬁeld of E = GF(pn ). Then F must be a ﬁeld extension of K that contains pm elements, where K is isomorphic to Zp . Then m | n, since [E : K] = [E : F ][F : K]. To prove the converse, suppose that m | n for some m > 0. Then pm − 1 m n m divides pn −1. Consequently, xp −1 −1 divides xp −1 −1. Therefore, xp −x n m n must divide xp − x, and every zero of xp − x is also a zero of xp − x. m Thus, GF(pn ) contains, as a subﬁeld, a splitting ﬁeld of xp − x, which must be isomorphic to GF(pm ). Example 2. The lattice of subﬁelds of GF(p24 ) is given inFigure 20.1. With each ﬁeld F we have a multiplicative group of nonzero elements of F which we will denote by F ∗ . The multiplicative group of any ﬁnite ﬁeld is cyclic. This result follows from the more general result that we will prove in the next theorem.

Let m be the least common multiple of pe1 , . . . , pek . Then G contains an 1 k element of order m. Since every α in G satisﬁes xr − 1 for some r dividing m, α must also be a root of xm − 1. Since xm − 1 has at most m roots in F , n ≤ m. On the other hand, we know that m ≤ |G|; therefore, m = n. Thus, G contains an element of order n and must be cyclic. Corollary 20.8 The multiplicative group of all nonzero elements of a ﬁnite ﬁeld is cyclic. Corollary 20.9 Every ﬁnite extension E of a ﬁnite ﬁeld F is a simple extension of F . Proof. Let α be a generator for the cyclic group E ∗ of nonzero elements of E. Then E = F (α).

Polynomial Codes

With knowledge of polynomial rings and ﬁnite ﬁelds, it is now possible to derive more sophisticated codes than those of Chapter 7. First let us recall that an (n, k)-block code consists of a one-to-one encoding function E : Zk → Zn and a decoding function D : Zn → Zk . The code is error2 2 2 2 correcting if D is onto. A code is a linear code if it is the null space of a matrix H ∈ Mk×n (Z2 ). We are interested in a class of codes known as cyclic codes. Let φ : k → Zn be a binary (n, k)-block code. Then φ is a cyclic code if for every Z2 2 codeword (a1 , a2 , . . . , an ), the cyclically shifted n-tuple (an , a1 , a2 , . . . , an−1 ) is also a codeword. Cyclic codes are particularly easy to implement on a computer using shift registers [2, 3]. Example 4. Consider the (6, 3)-linear codes generated by the two matrices     G1 =     1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1   1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1     .   

       and G2 =       

Messages in the ﬁrst code are encoded as follows: (000) (001) (010) (011) → → → → (000000) (001001) (010010) (011011) (100) (101) (110) (111) → → → → (100100) (101101) (110110) (111111).

It is easy to see that the codewords form a cyclic code. In the second code, 3-tuples are encoded in the following manner: (000) (001) (010) (011) → → → → (000000) (001111) (011110) (010001) (100) (101) (110) (111) → → → → (111100) (110011) (100010) (101101).

This code cannot be cyclic, since (101101) is a codeword but (011011) is not a codeword.

Polynomial Codes
We would like to ﬁnd an easy method of obtaining cyclic linear codes. To accomplish this, we can use our knowledge of ﬁnite ﬁelds and polynomial rings over Z2 . Any binary n-tuple can be interpreted as a polynomial in Z2 [x]. Stated another way, the n-tuple (a0 , a1 , . . . , an−1 ) corresponds to the polynomial f (x) = a0 + a1 x + · · · + an−1 xn−1 , where the degree of f (x) is at most n − 1. For example, the polynomial corresponding to the 5-tuple (10011) is 1 + 0x + 0x2 + 1x3 + 1x4 = 1 + x3 + x4 . Conversely, with any polynomial f (x) ∈ Z2 [x] with deg f (x) < n we can associate a binary n-tuple. The polynomial x + x2 + x4 corresponds to the 5-tuple (01101). Let us ﬁx a nonconstant polynomial g(x) in Z2 [x] of degree n − k. We can deﬁne an (n, k)-code C in the following manner. If (a0 , . . . , ak−1 ) is a k-tuple to be encoded, then f (x) = a0 + a1 x + · · · + ak−1 xk−1 is the corresponding polynomial in Z2 [x]. To encode f (x), we multiply by g(x). The codewords in C are all those polynomials in Z2 [x] of degree less than n that are divisible by g(x). Codes obtained in this manner are called polynomial codes. Example 5. If we let g(x) = 1+x3 , we can deﬁne a (6, 3)-code C as follows. To encode a 3-tuple (a0 , a1 , a2 ), we multiply the corresponding polynomial

20.2

POLYNOMIAL CODES

353

f (x) = a0 + a1 x + a2 x2 by 1 + x3 . We are deﬁning a map φ : Z3 → Z6 2 2 by φ : f (x) → g(x)f (x). It is easy to check that this map is a group homomorphism. In fact, if we regard Zn as a vector space over Z2 , φ is a 2 linear transformation of vector spaces (see Exercise 13, Chapter 18). Let us compute the kernel of φ. Observe that φ(a0 , a1 , a2 ) = (000000) exactly when 0 + 0x + 0x2 + 0x3 + 0x4 + 0x5 = (1 + x3 )(a0 + a1 x + a2 x2 ) = a0 + a1 x + a2 x2 + a0 x3 + a1 x4 + a2 x5 . Since the polynomials over a ﬁeld form an integral domain, a0 + a1 x + a2 x2 must be the zero polynomial. Therefore, ker φ = {(000)} and φ is one-to-one. To calculate a generator matrix for C, we merely need to examine the way the polynomials 1, x, and x2 are encoded: (1 + x3 ) · 1 = 1 + x3 (1 + x3 )x = x + x4 (1 + x3 )x3 = x2 + x5 . We obtain the code corresponding to the generator matrix G1 in Example 4. The parity-check matrix for this code is   1 0 0 1 0 0 H =  0 1 0 0 1 0 . 0 0 1 0 0 1 Since the smallest weight of any nonzero codeword is 2, this code has the ability to detect all single errors. Rings of polynomials have a great deal of structure; therefore, our immediate goal is to establish a link between polynomial codes and ring theory. Recall that xn − 1 = (x − 1)(xn−1 + · · · + x + 1). The factor ring Rn = Z2 [x]/ xn − 1 can be considered to be the ring of polynomials of the form f (t) = a0 + a1 t + · · · + an−1 tn−1 that satisfy the condition tn = 1. It is an easy exercise to show that Zn and 2 Rn are isomorphic as vector spaces. We will often identify elements in Zn 2 with elements in Z[x]/ xn − 1 . In this manner we can interpret a linear code as a subset of Z[x]/ xn − 1 .

354

CHAPTER 20

FINITE FIELDS

The additional ring structure on polynomial codes is very powerful in describing cyclic codes. A cyclic shift of an n-tuple can be described by polynomial multiplication. If f (t) = a0 + a1 t + · · · + an−1 tn−1 is a code polynomial in Rn , then tf (t) = an−1 + a0 t + · · · + an−2 tn−1 is the cyclically shifted word obtained from multiplying f (t) by t. The following theorem gives a beautiful classiﬁcation of cyclic codes in terms of the ideals of Rn . Theorem 20.10 A linear code C in Zn is cyclic if and only if it is an ideal 2 in Rn = Z[x]/ xn − 1 . Proof. Let C be a linear cyclic code and suppose that f (t) is in C. Then tf (t) must also be in C. Consequently, tk f (t) is in C for all k ∈ N. Since C is a linear code, any linear combination of the codewords f (t), tf (t), t2 f (t), . . . , tn−1 f (t) is also a codeword; therefore, for every polynomial p(t), p(t)f (t) is in C. Hence, C is an ideal. Conversely, let C be an ideal in Z2 [x]/ xn + 1 . Suppose that f (t) = a0 + a1 t + · · · + an−1 tn−1 is a codeword in C. Then tf (t) is a codeword in C; that is, (a1 , . . . , an−1 , a0 ) is in C. Theorem 20.10 tells us that knowing the ideals of Rn is equivalent to knowing the linear cyclic codes in Zn . Fortunately, the ideals in Rn are easy 2 to describe. The natural ring homomorphism φ : Z2 [x] → Rn deﬁned by φ[f (x)] = f (t) is a surjective homomorphism. The kernel of φ is the ideal generated by xn − 1. By Theorem 14.14, every ideal C in Rn is of the form φ(I), where I is an ideal in Z2 [x] that contains xn − 1 . By Theorem 15.12, we know that every ideal I in Z2 [x] is a principal ideal, since Z2 is a ﬁeld. Therefore, I = g(x) for some unique monic polynomial in Z2 [x]. Since xn − 1 is contained in I, it must be the case that g(x) divides xn − 1. Consequently, every ideal C in Rn is of the form C = g(t) = {f (t)g(t) : f (t) ∈ Rn and g(x) | (xn − 1) in Z2 [x]}. The unique monic polynomial of the smallest degree that generates C is called the minimal generator polynomial of C. Example 6. If we factor x7 − 1 into irreducible components, we have x7 − 1 = (1 + x)(1 + x + x3 )(1 + x2 + x3 ).

We see that g(t) = (1 + t + t3 ) generates an ideal C in R7 . This code is a (7, 4)-block code. As in Example 5, it is easy to calculate a generator matrix by examining what g(t) does to the polynomials 1, t, t2 , and t3 . A generator matrix for C is   1 0 0 0  1 1 0 0     0 1 1 0    G =  1 0 1 1 .    0 1 0 1     0 0 1 0  0 0 0 1

In general, we can determine a generator matrix for an (n, k)-code C by the manner in which the elements tk are encoded. Let xn − 1 = g(x)h(x) in Z2 [x]. If g(x) = g0 + g1 x + · · · + gn−k xn−k and h(x) = h0 + h1 x + · · · + hk xk , then the n × k matrix   g0 0 ··· 0  g1 g0 ··· 0     . . .  .. . .   . . . .   . g0  G =  gn−k gn−k−1 · · ·    0 gn−k · · · g1     . . .  .. . .   . . . . . 0 0 ··· gn−k is a generator matrix for the code C with generator polynomial g(t). The parity-check matrix for C is the (n − k) × n matrix 0  0 H=  ··· hk  ··· ··· ··· ··· 0 0 ··· h0 0 hk ··· 0 hk ··· ··· 0 ··· h0 ··· ···  h0 0  . ···  0

We will leave the details of the proof of the following proposition as an exercise. Proposition 20.11 Let C = g(t) be a cyclic code in Rn and suppose that xn − 1 = g(x)h(x). Then G and H are generator and parity-check matrices for C, respectively. Furthermore, HG = 0.

356 Example 7. In Example 6,

x7 − 1 = g(x)h(x) = (1 + x + x3 )(1 + x + x2 + x4 ). Therefore, a parity-check matrix for this  0 0 1 0  0 1 0 1 H= 1 0 1 1 code is  1 1 1 1 1 0 . 1 0 0

To determine the error-detecting and error-correcting capabilities of a cyclic code, we need to know something about determinants. If α1 , . . . , αn are elements in a ﬁeld F , then the n × n matrix   1 1 ··· 1  α1 α2 · · · αn    2 2  α2 α2 · · · αn  1    . . .  .. . .   . . . . .

is called the Vandermonde matrix. The determinant of this matrix is called the Vandermonde determinant. We will need the following lemma in our investigation of cyclic codes. Lemma 20.12 Let α1 , . . . , αn  1 1  α1 α2  2 2  α2 det  α1  . . .  . . . be elements in a ﬁeld F with n ≥ 2. Then  ··· 1 ··· αn   2 ··· αn  = (αi − αj ).  .  1≤j<i≤n .. .  . .

n−1 n−1 ··· α1 α2

In particular, if the αi ’s are distinct, then the determinant is nonzero. Proof. We will induct on n. If n = 2, then the determinant is α2 − α1 . Let us assume the result for n − 1 and consider the polynomial p(x) deﬁned by   1 1 ··· 1 1  α1 α2 · · · αn−1 x    2 2 2  α2 · · · αn−1 x2  . p(x) = det  α1   . . . .  .. . . . .   . . . . . n−1 n−1 n−1 n−1 α1 α2 · · · αn−1 x

Expanding this determinant by cofactors on the last column, we see that p(x) is a polynomial of at most degree n − 1. Moreover, the roots of p(x) are α1 , . . . , αn−1 , since the substitution of any one of these elements in the last column will produce a column identical to the last column in the matrix. Remember that the determinant of a matrix is zero if it has two identical columns. Therefore, p(x) = (x − α1 )(x − α2 ) · · · (x − αn−1 )β, where     β = (−1)n+n det    By our induction hypothesis, β = (−1)n+n (αi − αj ).

If we let x = αn , the result now follows immediately. The following theorem gives us an estimate on the error detection and correction capabilities for a particular generator polynomial. Theorem 20.13 Let C = g(t) be a cyclic code in Rn and suppose that ω is a primitive nth root of unity over Z2 . If s consecutive powers of ω are roots of g(x), then the minimum distance of C is at least s + 1. Proof. Suppose that g(ω r ) = g(ω r+1 ) = · · · = g(ω r+s−1 ) = 0. Let f (x) be some polynomial in C with s or fewer nonzero coeﬃcients. We can assume that f (x) = ai0 xi0 + ai1 xi1 + · · · + ais−1 xis−1 be some polynomial in C. It will suﬃce to show that all of the ai ’s must be 0. Since g(ω r ) = g(ω r+1 ) = · · · = g(ω r+s−1 ) = 0

358 and g(x) divides f (x),

f (ω r ) = f (ω r+1 ) = · · · = f (ω r+s−1 ) = 0. Equivalently, we have the following system of equations: ai0 (ω r )i0 + ai1 (ω r )i1 + · · · + ais−1 (ω r )is−1 ai0 (ω

BCH Codes
Some of the most important codes, discovered independently by A. Hocquenghem in 1959 and by R. C. Bose and D. V. Ray-Chaudhuri in 1960, are BCH codes. The European and transatlantic communication systems both use BCH codes. Information words to be encoded are of length 231, and a polynomial of degree 24 is used to generate the code. Since 231 + 24 = 255 = 28 − 1, we are dealing with a (255, 231)-block code. This BCH code will detect six errors and has a failure rate of 1 in 16 million. One advantage of BCH codes is that eﬃcient error correction algorithms exist for them.

20.2

POLYNOMIAL CODES

The idea behind BCH codes is to choose a generator polynomial of smallest degree that has the largest error detection and error correction capabilities. Let d = 2r + 1 for some r ≥ 0. Suppose that ω is a primitive nth root of unity over Z2 , and let mi (x) be the minimal polynomial over Z2 of ω i . If g(x) = lcm[m1 (x), m2 (x), . . . , m2r (x)], then the cyclic code g(t) in Rn is called the BCH code of length n and distance d. By Theorem 20.13, the minimum distance of C is at least d. Theorem 20.14 Let C = g(t) be a cyclic code in Rn . The following statements are equivalent. 1. The code C is a BCH code whose minimum distance is at least d. 2. A code polynomial f (t) is in C if and only if f (ω i ) = 0 for 1 ≤ i < d. 3. The matrix     H=   1 ω ω2 2 1 ω ω4 1 ω3 ω6 . . . . . . . . . 2r ω 4r 1 ω ··· ··· ··· .. . ··· ω n−1 ω (n−1)(2) ω (n−1)(3) . . . (n−1)(2r) ω       

is a parity-check matrix for C. Proof. (1) ⇒ (2). If f (t) is in C, then g(x) | f (x) in Z2 [x]. Hence, for i = 1, . . . , 2r, f (ω i ) = 0 since g(ω i ) = 0. Conversely, suppose that f (ω i ) = 0 for 1 ≤ i ≤ d. Then f (x) is divisible by each mi (x), since mi (x) is the minimal polynomial of ω i . Therefore, g(x) | f (x) by the deﬁnition of g(x). Consequently, f (x) is a codeword. (2) ⇒ (3). Let f (t) = a0 + a1 t + · · · + an−1 vtn−1 be in Rn . The corresponding n-tuple in Zn is x = (a0 a1 · · · an−1 )t . By (2), 2    Hx =   a0 + a1 ω + · · · + an−1 ω n−1 a0 + a1 ω 2 + · · · + an−1 (ω 2 )n−1 . . . a0 + a1 ω 2r + · · · + an−1 (ω 2r )n−1   f (ω) f (ω 2 ) . . . f (ω 2r )    =0 

exactly when f (t) is in C. Thus, H is a parity-check matrix for C.

(3) ⇒ (1). By (3), a code polynomial f (t) = a0 + a1 t + · · · + an−1 tn−1 is in C exactly when f (ω i ) = 0 for i = 1, . . . , 2r. The smallest such polynomial is g(t) = lcm[m1 (t), . . . , m2r (t)]. Therefore, C = g(t) . Example 8. It is easy to verify that x15 − 1 ∈ Z2 [x] has a factorization x15 − 1 = (x + 1)(x2 + x + 1)(x4 + x + 1)(x4 + x3 + 1)(x4 + x3 + x2 + x + 1), where each of the factors is an irreducible polynomial. Let ω be a root of 1 + x + x4 . The Galois ﬁeld GF(24 ) is {a0 + a1 ω + a2 ω 2 + a3 ω 3 : ai ∈ Z2 and 1 + ω + ω 4 = 0}. By Example 3, ω is a primitive 15th root of unity. The minimal polynomial of ω is m1 (x) = 1 + x + x4 . It is easy to see that ω 2 and ω 4 are also roots of m1 (x). The minimal polynomial of ω 3 is m2 (x) = 1 + x + x2 + x3 + x4 . Therefore, g(x) = m1 (x)m2 (x) = 1 + x4 + x6 + x7 + x8 has roots ω, ω 2 , ω 3 , ω 4 . Since both m1 (x) and m2 (x) divide x15 −1, the BCH code is a (15, 7)-code. If x15 − 1 = g(x)h(x), then h(x) = 1 + x4 + x6 + x7 ; therefore, a parity-check matrix for this code is   0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1  0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0     0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0     0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0     0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 .    0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0     0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0  1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Additional Exercises: Error Correction for BCH Codes
BCH codes have very attractive error correction algorithms. Let C be a BCH code in Rn , and suppose that a code polynomial c(t) = c0 + c1 t + · · · + cn−1 tn−1 is transmitted. Let w(t) = w0 + w1 t + · · · wn−1 tn−1 be the polynomial in Rn that is received. If errors have occurred in bits a1 , . . . , ak , then w(t) = c(t) + e(t), where e(t) = ta1 + ta2 + · · · + tak is the error polynomial. The decoder must determine the integers ai and then recover c(t) from w(t) by ﬂipping the ai th bit. From w(t) we can compute w(ω i ) = si for i = 1, . . . , 2r, where ω is a primitive nth root of unity over Z2 . We say the syndrome of w(t) is s1 , . . . , s2r . 1. Show that w(t) is a code polynomial if and only if si = 0 for all i. 2. Show that si = w(ω i ) = e(ω i ) = ω ia1 + ω ia2 + · · · + ω iak for i = 1, . . . , 2r. The error-locator polynomial is deﬁned to be s(x) = (x + ω a1 )(x + ω a2 ) · · · (x + ω ak ). 3. Recall the (15, 7)-block BCH code in Example 7. By Theorem 7.3, this code is capable of correcting two errors. Suppose that these errors occur in bits a1 and a2 . The error-locator polynomial is s(x) = (x + ω a1 )(x + ω a2 ). Show that s3 . s(x) = x2 + s1 x + s2 + 1 s1 4. Let w(t) = 1 + t2 + t4 + t5 + t7 + t12 + t13 . Determine what the originally transmitted code polynomial was.

Galois Theory

A classic problem of algebra has been to ﬁnd the solutions of a polynomial equation. The solution to the quadratic equation was known in antiquity. Italian mathematicians found general solutions to the general cubic and quartic equations in the sixteenth century; however, attempts to solve the general ﬁfth-degree, or quintic, polynomial were repulsed for the next three hundred years. Certainly, equations such as x5 − 1 = 0 or x6 − x3 − 6 = 0 could be solved, but no solution like the quadratic formula was found for the general quintic, ax5 + bx4 + cx3 + dx2 + ex + f = 0. Finally, at the beginning of the nineteenth century, Ruﬃni and Abel both found quintics that could not be solved with any formula. It was Galois, however, who provided the full explanation by showing which polynomials could and could not be solved by formulas. He discovered the connection between groups and ﬁeld extensions. Galois theory demonstrates the strong interdependence of group and ﬁeld theory, and has had far-reaching implications beyond its original purpose. In this chapter we will prove the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory. This result will be used to establish the insolvability of the quintic and to prove the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra.

21.1

Field Automorphisms

Our ﬁrst task is to establish a link between group theory and ﬁeld theory by examining automorphisms of ﬁelds. Proposition 21.1 The set of all automorphisms of a ﬁeld F is a group under composition of functions. 364

21.1

FIELD AUTOMORPHISMS

365

Proof. If σ and τ are automorphisms of E, then so are στ and σ −1 . The identity is certainly an automorphism; hence, the set of all automorphisms of a ﬁeld F is indeed a group. Proposition 21.2 Let E be a ﬁeld extension of F . Then the set of all automorphisms of E that ﬁx F elementwise is a group; that is, the set of all automorphisms σ : E → E such that σ(α) = α for all α ∈ F is a group. Proof. We need only show that the set of automorphisms of E that ﬁx F elementwise is a subgroup of the group of all automorphisms of E. Let σ and τ be two automorphisms of E such that σ(α) = α and τ (α) = α for all α ∈ F . Then στ (α) = σ(α) = α and σ −1 (α) = α. Since the identity ﬁxes every element of E, the set of automorphisms of E that leave elements of F ﬁxed is a subgroup of the entire group of automorphisms of E. Let E be a ﬁeld extension of F . We will denote the full group of automorphisms of E by Aut(E). We deﬁne the Galois group of E over F to be the group of automorphisms of E that ﬁx F elementwise; that is, G(E/F ) = {σ ∈ Aut(E) : σ(α) = α for all α ∈ F }. If f (x) is a polynomial in F [x] and E is the splitting ﬁeld of f (x) over F , then we deﬁne the Galois group of f (x) to be G(E/F ). Example 1. Complex conjugation, deﬁned by σ : a + bi → a − bi, is an automorphism of the complex numbers. Since σ(a) = σ(a + 0i) = a − 0i = a, the automorphism deﬁned by complex conjugation must be in G(C/R). √ √ √ Example 2. Consider the ﬁelds Q ⊂ Q( 5 ) ⊂ Q( 3, 5 ). Then for √ a, b ∈ Q( 5 ), √ √ σ(a + b 3 ) = a − b 3 √ √ √ is an automorphism of Q( 3, 5 ) leaving Q( 5 ) ﬁxed. Similarly, √ √ τ (a + b 5 ) = a − b 5 √ √ √ is an automorphism of Q( 3, √5 ) leaving Q( 3 ) ﬁxed. The automorphism √ µ = στ moves both 3 and 5. It will soon be clear that {id, σ, τ, µ} is

The following table shows that this group is isomorphic to Z2 × Z2 . id σ τ µ id id σ τ µ σ σ id µ τ τ τ µ id σ µ µ τ σ id √ √ We may also√regard √ ﬁeld Q( 3, 5 ) as a vector space over Q that the √ √ √ has√ √ {1, 3, 5, 15 }. It is no coincidence that |G(Q( 3, 5 )/Q)| = basis [Q( 3, 5 ) : Q)] = 4. Proposition 21.3 Let E be a ﬁeld extension of F and f (x) be a polynomial in F [x]. Then any automorphism in G(E/F ) deﬁnes a permutation of the roots of f (x) that lie in E. Proof. Let f (x) = a0 + a1 x + a2 x2 + · · · + an xn

and suppose that α ∈ E is a zero of f (x). Then for σ ∈ G(E/F ), 0 = σ(0) = σ(f (α)) = σ(a0 + a1 α + a2 α2 + · · · + an αn ) = a0 + a1 σ(α) + a2 [σ(α)]2 + · · · + an [σ(α)]n ; therefore, σ(α) is also a zero of f (x). Let E be an algebraic extension of a ﬁeld F . Two elements α, β ∈ E are conjugate over F if they have the same minimal polynomial. For example, √ √ √ in the ﬁeld Q( 2 ) the elements 2 and − 2 are conjugate over Q since they are both roots of the irreducible polynomial x2 − 2. A converse of the last proposition exists. The proof follows directly from Lemma 19.18. Proposition 21.4 If α and β are conjugate over F , there exists an isomorphism σ : F (α) → F (β) such that σ is the identity when restricted to F . Theorem 21.5 Let f (x) be a polynomial in F [x] and suppose that E is the splitting ﬁeld for f (x) over F . If f (x) has no repeated roots, then |G(E/F )| = [E : F ].

21.1

FIELD AUTOMORPHISMS

Proof. The proof is similar to the proof of Theorem 19.19. We will use mathematical induction on the degree of f (x). If the degree of f (x) is 0 or 1, then E = F and there is nothing to show. Assume that the result holds for all polynomials of degree k with 0 ≤ k < n. Let p(x) be an irreducible factor of f (x) of degree r. Since all of the roots of p(x) are in E, we can choose one of these roots, say α, so that F ⊂ F (α) ⊂ E. If β is any other root of p(x), then F ⊂ F (β) ⊂ E. By Lemma 19.18, there exists a unique isomorphism σ : F (α) → F (β) for each such β that ﬁxes F elementwise. Since E is a splitting ﬁeld of F (β), there are exactly r such isomorphisms. We can factor p(x) in F (α) as p(x) = (x − α)p1 (x). The degrees of p1 (x) and q1 (x) are both less than r. Since we know that E is the splitting ﬁeld of p1 (x) over F (α), we can apply the induction hypothesis to conclude that |G(E/F (α))| = [E : F (α)]. Consequently, there are [E : F ] = [E : F (α)][F (α) : F ] possible automorphisms of E that ﬁx F , or |G(E/F )| = [E : F ]. Corollary 21.6 Let F be a ﬁnite ﬁeld with a ﬁnite extension E such that [E : F ] = k. T hen G(E/F ) is cyclic. Proof. Let p be the characteristic of E and F and assume that the orders of E and F are pm and pn , respectively. Then nk = m. We can also assume m that E is the splitting ﬁeld of xp − x over a subﬁeld of order p. Therefore, m E must also be the splitting ﬁeld of xp −x over F . Applying Theorem 21.5, we ﬁnd that |G(E/F )| = k. To prove that G(E/F ) is cyclic, we must ﬁnd a generator for G(E/F ). n Let σ : E → E be deﬁned by σ(α) = αp . We claim that σ is the element in G(E/F ) that we are seeking. We ﬁrst need to show that σ is in Aut(E). If α and β are in E, σ(α + β) = (α + β)p = αp + β p = σ(α) + σ(β) by Lemma 20.3. Also, it is easy to show that σ(αβ) = σ(α)σ(β). Since σ is a nonzero homomorphism of ﬁelds, it must be injective. It must also be onto, since E is a ﬁnite ﬁeld. We know that σ must be in G(E/F ), since n F is the splitting ﬁeld of xp − x over the base ﬁeld of order p. This means that σ leaves every element in F ﬁxed. Finally, we must show that the order k of σ is k. By Theorem 21.5, we know that σ k (α) = αp = α is the identity

of G(E/F ). However, σ r cannot be the identity for 1 ≤ r < k; otherwise, rk xp − x would have pm roots, which is impossible. √ √ Example 3. We can now conﬁrm that the Galois group of Q( 3, 5 ) over Q in Example 2 is indeed isomorphic √ Z2 × Z2 . Certainly the group √ to H = {id, σ, τ, µ} is a subgroup of G(Q( 3, 5 )/Q); however, H must be all √ √ of G(Q( 3, 5 )/Q), since √ √ √ √ |H| = [Q( 3, 5 ) : Q] = |G(Q( 3, 5 )/Q)| = 4.

Example 4. Let us compute the Galois group of f (x) = x4 + x3 + x2 + x + 1 over Q. We know that f (x) is irreducible by Exercise 19 in Chapter 15. Furthermore, since (x − 1)f (x) = x5 − 1, we can use DeMoivre’s Theorem to determine that the roots of f (x) are ω i , where i = 1, . . . , 4 and ω = cos(2π/5) + i sin(2π/5). Hence, the splitting ﬁeld of f (x) must be Q(ω). We can deﬁne automorphisms σi of Q(ω) by σi (ω) = ω i for i = 1, . . . , 4. It is easy to check that these are indeed distinct automorphisms in G(Q(ω)/Q). Since [Q(ω) : Q] = |G(Q(ω)/Q)| = 4, the σi ’s must be all of G(Q(ω)/Q). Therefore, G(Q(ω)/Q) ∼ Z4 since ω is = a generator for the Galois group.

Separable Extensions
Many of the results that we have just proven depend on the fact that a polynomial f (x) in F [x] has no repeated roots in its splitting ﬁeld. It is evident that we need to know exactly when a polynomial factors into distinct linear factors in its splitting ﬁeld. Let E be the splitting ﬁeld of a polynomial f (x) in F [x]. Suppose that f (x) factors over E as

of degree n is separable if it has n distinct roots in its splitting ﬁeld E. Equivalently, f (x) is separable if it factors into distinct linear factors over E[x]. An extension E of F is a separable extension of F if every element in E is the root of a separable polynomial in F [x]. Also recall that f (x) is separable if and only if gcd(f (x), f (x)) = 1 (Lemma 20.4). Proposition 21.7 Let f (x) be an irreducible polynomial over F [x]. If the characteristic of F is 0, then f (x) is separable. If the characteristic of F is p and f (x) = g(xp ) for some g(x) in F [x], then f (x) is also separable. Proof. First assume that charF = 0. Since deg f (x) < deg f (x) and f (x) is irreducible, the only way gcd(f (x), f (x)) = 1 is if f (x) is the zero polynomial; however, this is impossible in a ﬁeld of characteristic zero. If charF = p, then f (x) can be the zero polynomial if every coeﬃcient of f (x) is a multiple of p. This can happen only if we have a polynomial of the form f (x) = a0 + a1 xp + a2 x2p + · · · + an xnp . Certainly extensions of a ﬁeld F of the form F (α) are some of the easiest to study and understand. Given a ﬁeld extension E of F , the obvious question to ask is when it is possible to ﬁnd an element α ∈ E such that E = F (α). In this case, α is called a primitive element. We already know that primitive elements exist for certain extensions. For example, √ √ √ √ Q( 3, 5 ) = Q( 3 + 5 ) and √ √ √ 3 6 Q( 5, 5 i) = Q( 5 i).

Corollary 20.9 tells us that there exists a primitive element for any ﬁnite extension of a ﬁnite ﬁeld. The next theorem tells us that we can often ﬁnd a primitive element. Theorem 21.8 (Primitive Element Theorem) Let E be a ﬁnite separable extension of a ﬁeld F . Then there exists an α ∈ E such that E = F (α). Proof. We already know that there is no problem if F is a ﬁnite ﬁeld. Suppose that E is a ﬁnite extension of an inﬁnite ﬁeld. We will prove the result for F (α, β). The general case easily follows when we use mathematical induction. Let f (x) and g(x) be the minimal polynomials of α and β, respectively. Let K be the ﬁeld in which both f (x) and g(x) split. Suppose that f (x) has zeros α = α1 , . . . , αn in K and g(x) has zeros β = β1 , . . . , βm

in K. All of these zeros have multiplicity 1, since E is separable over F . Since F is inﬁnite, we can ﬁnd an a in F such that a= αi − α β − βj

for all i and j with j = 1. Therefore, a(β − βj ) = αi − α. Let γ = α + aβ. Then γ = α + aβ = αi + aβj ; hence, γ − aβj = αi for all i, j with j = 1. Deﬁne h(x) ∈ F (γ)[x] by h(x) = f (γ − ax). Then h(β) = f (α) = 0. However, h(βj ) = 0 for j = 1. Hence, h(x) and g(x) have a single common factor in F (γ)[x]; that is, the irreducible polynomial of β over F (γ) must be linear, since β is the only zero common to both g(x) and h(x). So β ∈ F (γ) and α = γ − aβ is in F (γ). Hence, F (α, β) = F (γ).

21.2

The Fundamental Theorem

The goal of this section is to prove the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory. This theorem explains the connection between the subgroups of G(E/F ) and the intermediate ﬁelds between E and F . Proposition 21.9 Let {σi : i ∈ I} be a collection of automorphisms of a ﬁeld F . Then F{σi } = {a ∈ F : σi (a) = a for all σi } is a subﬁeld of F . Proof. Let σi (a) = a and σi (b) = b. Then σi (a ± b) = σi (a) ± σi (b) = a ± b and σi (ab) = σi (a)σi (b) = ab. If a = 0, then σi (a−1 ) = [σi (a)]−1 = a−1 . Finally, σi (0) = 0 and σi (1) = 1 since σi is an automorphism. Corollary 21.10 Let F be a ﬁeld and let G be a subgroup of Aut(F ). Then FG = {α ∈ F : σ(α) = α for all σ ∈ G} is a subﬁeld of F .

21.2

THE FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM

371

The subﬁeld F{σi } of F is called the ﬁxed ﬁeld of {σi }. The ﬁeld ﬁxed for a subgroup G of Aut(F ) will be denoted by FG . √ √ √ √ Example 5. Let σ : Q( 3, √ 5 ) → Q( 3, 5 ) be the automorphism that √ √ √ √ maps 3 to − 3. Then Q( 5 ) is the subﬁeld of Q( 3, 5 ) left ﬁxed by σ. Proposition 21.11 Let E be a splitting ﬁeld over F of a separable polynomial. Then EG(E/F ) = F . Proof. Let G = G(E/F ). Clearly, F ⊂ EG ⊂ E. Also, E must be a splitting ﬁeld of EG and G(E/F ) = G(E/EG ). By Theorem 21.5, |G| = [E : EG ] = [E : F ]. Therefore, [EG : F ] = 1. Consequently, EG = F . A large number of mathematicians ﬁrst learned Galois theory from Emil Artin’s monograph on the subject [1]. The very clever proof of the following lemma is due to Artin. Lemma 21.12 Let G be a ﬁnite group of automorphisms of E and let F = EG . Then [E : F ] ≤ |G|. Proof. Let |G| = n. We must show that any set of n + 1 elements α1 , . . . , αn+1 in E is linearly dependent over F ; that is, we need to ﬁnd elements ai ∈ F , not all zero, such that a1 α1 + a2 α2 + · · · + an+1 αn+1 = 0. Suppose that σ1 = id, σ2 , . . . , σn are the automorphisms in G. The homogeneous system of linear equations σ1 (α1 )x1 + σ1 (α2 )x2 + · · · + σ1 (αn+1 )xn+1 = 0 σ2 (α1 )x1 + σ2 (α2 )x2 + · · · + σ2 (αn+1 )xn+1 = 0 . . . σn (α1 )x1 + σn (α2 )x2 + · · · + σn (αn+1 )xn+1 = 0 has more equations than unknowns. From linear algebra we know that this system has a nontrivial solution, say xi = ai for i = 1, 2, . . . , n + 1. Since σ1 is the identity, the ﬁrst equation translates to a1 α1 + a2 α2 + · · · + an+1 αn+1 = 0.

372

CHAPTER 21

GALOIS THEORY

The problem is that some of the ai ’s may be in E but not in F . We must show that this is impossible. Suppose that at least one of the ai ’s is in E but not in F . By rearranging the αi ’s we may assume that a1 is nonzero. Since any nonzero multiple of a solution is also a solution, we can also assume that a1 = 1. Of all possible solutions ﬁtting this description, we choose the one with the smallest number of nonzero terms. Again, by rearranging α2 , . . . , αn+1 if necessary, we can assume that a2 is in E but not in F . Since F is the subﬁeld of E that is ﬁxed elementwise by G, there exists a σi in G such that σi (a2 ) = a2 . Applying σi to each equation in the system, we end up with the same homogeneous system, since G is a group. Therefore, x1 = σi (a1 ) = 1, x2 = σi (a2 ), . . ., xn+1 = σi (an+1 ) is also a solution of the original system. We know that a linear combination of two solutions of a homogeneous system is also a solution; consequently, x1 = 1 − 1 = 0 x2 = a2 − σi (a2 ) . . . xn+1 = an+1 − σi (an+1 ) must be another solution of the system. This is a nontrivial solution because σi (a2 ) = a2 , and has fewer nonzero entries than our original solution. This is a contradiction, since the number of nonzero solutions to our original solution was assumed to be minimal. We can therefore conclude that a1 = · · · = an+1 = 0. Let E be an algebraic extension of F . If every irreducible polynomial in F [x] with a root in E has all of its roots in E, then E is called a normal extension of F ; that is, every irreducible polynomial in F [x] containing a root in E is the product of linear factors in E[x]. Theorem 21.13 Let E be a ﬁeld extension of F . Then the following statements are equivalent. 1. E is a ﬁnite, normal, separable extension of F . 2. E is a splitting ﬁeld over F of a separable polynomial. 3. F = EG for some ﬁnite group of automorphisms of E. Proof. (1) ⇒ (2). Let E be a ﬁnite, normal, separable extension of F . By the Primitive Element Theorem, we can ﬁnd an α in E such that E = F (α).

21.2

THE FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM

373

Let f (x) be the minimal polynomial of α over F . The ﬁeld E must contain all of the roots of f (x) since it is a normal extension F ; hence, E is a splitting ﬁeld for f (x). (2) ⇒ (3). Let E be the splitting ﬁeld over F of a separable polynomial. By Proposition 21.11, EG(E/F ) = F . Since |G(E/F )| = [E : F ], this is a ﬁnite group. (3) ⇒ (1). Let F = EG for some ﬁnite group of automorphisms G of E. Since [E : F ] ≤ |G|, E is a ﬁnite extension of F . To show that E is a ﬁnite, normal extension of F , let f (x) ∈ F [x] be an irreducible monic polynomial that has a root α in E. We must show that f (x) is the product of distinct linear factors in E[x]. By Proposition 21.3, automorphisms in G permute the roots of f (x) lying in E. Hence, if we let G act on α, we can obtain distinct roots α1 = α, α2 , . . . , αn in E. Let g(x) = n (x − αi ). Then g(x) i=1 is separable over F and g(α) = 0. Any automorphism σ in G permutes the factors of g(x) since it permutes these roots; hence, when σ acts on g(x), it must ﬁx the coeﬃcients of g(x). Therefore, the coeﬃcients of g(x) must be in F . Since deg g(x) ≤ deg f (x) and f (x) is the minimal polynomial of α, f (x) = g(x). Corollary 21.14 Let K be a ﬁeld extension of F such that F = KG for some ﬁnite group of automorphisms G of K. Then G = G(K/F ). Proof. Since F = KG , G is a subgroup of G(K/F ). Hence, [K : F ] ≤ |G| ≤ |G(K/F )| = [K : F ]. It follows that G = G(K/F ), since they must have the same order. Before we determine the exact correspondence between ﬁeld extensions and automorphisms of ﬁelds, let us return to a familiar example. √ √ Example 6. In Example 2 we examined the automorphisms of Q( 3, 5 ) ﬁxing Q. Figure 21.1 compares the lattice of ﬁeld extensions of Q with the √ √ lattice of subgroups of G(Q( 3, 5 )/Q). The Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory tells us what the relationship is between the two lattices. We are now ready to state and prove the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory. Theorem 21.15 (Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory) Let F be a ﬁnite ﬁeld or a ﬁeld of characteristic zero. If E is a ﬁnite normal extension of F with Galois group G(E/F ), then the following statements are true.

1. The map K → G(E/K) is a bijection of subﬁelds K of E containing F with the subgroups of G(E/F ). 2. If F ⊂ K ⊂ E, then [E : K] = |G(E/K)| and [K : F ] = [G(E/F ) : G(E/K)]. 3. F ⊂ K ⊂ L ⊂ E if and only if {id} ⊂ G(E/L) ⊂ G(E/K) ⊂ G(E/F ). 4. K is a normal extension of F if and only if G(E/K) is a normal subgroup of G(E/F ). In this case G(K/F ) ∼ G(E/F )/G(E/K). = Proof. (1) Suppose that G(E/K) = G(E/L) = G. Both K and L are ﬁxed ﬁelds of G; hence, K = L and the map deﬁned by K → G(E/K) is one-to-one. To show that the map is onto, let G be a subgroup of G(E/F ) and K be the ﬁeld ﬁxed by G. Then F ⊂ K ⊂ E; consequently, E is a normal extension of K. Thus, G(E/K) = G and the map K → G(E/K) is a bijection. (2) By Proposition 21.5, |G(E/K)| = [E : K]; therefore, |G(E/F )| = [G(E/F ) : G(E/K)] · |G(E/K)| = [E : F ] = [E : K][K : F ]. Thus, [K : F ] = [G(E/F ) : G(E/K)]. (3) Statement (3) is illustrated in Figure 21.2. We leave the proof of this property as an exercise. (4) This part takes a little more work. Let K be a normal extension of F . If σ is in G(E/F ) and τ is in G(E/K), we need to show that σ −1 τ σ

Figure 21.2. Subgroups of G(E/F ) and subﬁelds of E is in G(E/K); that is, we need to show that σ −1 τ σ(α) = α for all α ∈ K. Suppose that f (x) is the minimal polynomial of α over F . Then σ(α) is also a root of f (x) lying in K, since K is a normal extension of F . Hence, τ (σ(α)) = σ(α) or σ −1 τ σ(α) = α. Conversely, let G(E/K) be a normal subgroup of G(E/F ). We need to show that F = KG(K/F ) . Let τ ∈ G(E/K). For all σ ∈ G(E/F ) there exists a τ ∈ G(E/K) such that τ σ = στ . Consequently, for all α ∈ K τ (σ(α)) = σ(τ (α)) = σ(α); hence, σ(α) must be in the ﬁxed ﬁeld of G(E/K). Let σ be the restriction of σ to K. Then σ is an automorphism of K ﬁxing F , since σ(α) ∈ K for all α ∈ K; hence, σ ∈ G(K/F ). Next, we will show that the ﬁxed ﬁeld of G(K/F ) is F . Let β be an element in K that is ﬁxed by all automorphisms in G(K/F ). In particular, σ(β) = β for all σ ∈ G(E/F ). Therefore, β belongs to the ﬁxed ﬁeld F of G(E/F ). Finally, we must show that when K is a normal extension of F , G(K/F ) ∼ G(E/F )/G(E/K). = For σ ∈ G(E/F ), let σK be the automorphism of K obtained by restricting σ to K. Since K is a normal extension, the argument in the preceding paragraph shows that σK ∈ G(K/F ). Consequently, we have a map φ : G(E/F ) → G(K/F ) deﬁned by σ → σK . This map is a group homomorphism since φ(στ ) = (στ )K = σK τK = φ(σ)φ(τ ).

|G(E/F )|/|G(E/K)| = [K : F ] = |G(K/F )|. Hence, the image of φ is G(K/F ) and φ is onto. Applying the First Isomorphism Theorem, we have G(K/F ) ∼ G(E/F )/G(E/K). =

Example 7. In this example we will illustrate the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory by determining the lattice of subgroups of the Galois group of f (x) = x4 − 2. We will compare this lattice to the lattice of ﬁeld extensions of Q that √ contained in the splitting ﬁeld of x4 − 2. The splitting ﬁeld of are √ √ f (x) is Q( 4 2, i). To see this, notice that f√ factors as (x2 + 2 )(x2 − 2 ); (x) √ √ hence, the roots of f (x) are ± 4 2 and ± 4 2 i. We ﬁrst adjoin the root 4 2 √ to Q and then adjoin the root i of x2 + 1 to Q( 4 2 ). The splitting ﬁeld of √ √ f (x) is then Q( 4 2 )(i) = Q( 4 2, i). √ √ Since [Q( 4√ ) : Q] = 4 and i is not in Q( 4 2 ), it must be the case that 2 √ √ [Q( 4 2, i) : Q( 4 2 )] = 2. Hence, [Q( 4 2, i) : Q] = 8. The set √ √ √ √ √ √ 4 4 4 4 4 4 {1, 2, ( 2 )2 , ( 2 )3 , i, i 2, i( 2 )2 , i( 2 )3 } √ is a basis of Q( 4 2, i) over Q. The lattice of ﬁeld extensions of Q contained √ in Q( 4 2, i) is illustrated in Figure 21.3(a). The Galois group√ of f (x) must be of order 8. Let σ be the automorG √ 4 phism deﬁned by σ( 2 ) = 4 2 and σ(i) = i, and τ be the automorphism deﬁned by complex conjugation; that is, τ (i) = −i. Then G has an element of order 4 and an element of order 2. It is easy to verify by direct computation that the elements of G are {id, σ, σ 2 , σ 3 , τ, στ, σ 2 τ, σ 3 τ } and that the relations τ 2 = id, σ 4 = id, and τ στ = σ −1 are satisﬁed; hence, G must be isomorphic to D4 . The lattice of subgroups of G is illustrated in Figure 21.3(b). Historical Note
Solutions for the cubic and quartic equations were discovered in the 1500s. Attempts to ﬁnd solutions for the quintic equations puzzled some of history’s best mathematicians. In 1798, P. Ruﬃni submitted a paper that claimed no such solution could be found; however, the paper was not well received. In 1826, Niels Henrik Abel (1802–1829) ﬁnally oﬀered the ﬁrst correct proof that quintics are not always solvable by radicals.

´ Abel inspired the work of Evariste Galois. Born in 1811, Galois began to display extraordinary mathematical talent at the age of 14. He applied for entrance to the ´ Ecole Polytechnique several times; however, he had great diﬃculty meeting the formal entrance requirements, and the examiners failed to recognize his mathematical ´ genius. He was ﬁnally accepted at the Ecole Normale in 1829. Galois worked to develop a theory of solvability for polynomials. In 1829, at the age of 17, Galois presented two papers on the solution of algebraic equations to the Acad´mie des Sciences de Paris. These papers were sent to Cauchy, who e subsequently lost them. A third paper was submitted to Fourier, who died before he could read the paper. Another paper was presented, but was not published until 1846. Galois’s democratic sympathies led him into the Revolution of 1830. He was expelled from school and sent to prison for his part in the turmoil. After his release in 1832, he was drawn into a duel over a love aﬀair. Certain that he would be killed, he spent the evening before his death outlining his work and his basic ideas

Solvability by Radicals
Throughout this section we shall assume that all ﬁelds have characteristic zero to ensure that irreducible polynomials do not have multiple roots. The immediate goal of this section is to determine when the roots of a polynomial f (x) can be computed in a ﬁnite number of operations on the coeﬃcients of f (x). The allowable operations are addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and the extraction of nth roots. Certainly the solution to the quadratic equation, ax2 + bx + c = 0, illustrates this process: √ −b ± b2 − 4ac x= . 2a The only one of these operations that might demand a larger ﬁeld is the taking of nth roots. We are led to the following deﬁnition. An extension ﬁeld E of a ﬁeld F is an extension by radicals if there are elements α1 , . . . , αr ∈ K and positive integers n1 , . . . , nr such that E = F (α1 , . . . , αr ),
n where α1 1 ∈ F and n αi i ∈ F (α1 , . . . , αi−1 )

for i = 2, . . . , r. A polynomial f (x) is solvable by radicals over F if the splitting ﬁeld K of f (x) over F is contained in an extension of F by radicals. Our goal is to arrive at criteria that will tell us whether or not a polynomial f (x) is solvable by radicals by examining the Galois group f (x). The easiest polynomial to solve by radicals is one of the form xn − a. As we discussed in Chapter 3, the roots of xn − 1 are called the nth roots of unity. These roots are a ﬁnite subgroup of the splitting ﬁeld of xn − 1. By Theorem 20.7, the nth roots of unity form a cyclic group. Any generator of this group is called a primitive nth root of unity. Example 8. The polynomial xn − 1 is solvable by radicals over Q. The roots of this polynomial are 1, ω, ω 2 , . . . , ω n−1 , where ω = cos 2π n + i sin 2π n .

21.3

APPLICATIONS

The splitting ﬁeld of xn − 1 over Q is Q(ω). Recall that a subnormal series of a group G is a ﬁnite sequence of subgroups G = Hn ⊃ Hn−1 ⊃ · · · ⊃ H1 ⊃ H0 = {e}, where Hi is normal in Hi+1 . A subnormal series is a composition series if all the factor groups are simple; that is, if none of the factor groups of the series contains a normal subgroup. A group G is solvable if it has a composition series {Hi } such that all of the factor groups Hi+1 /Hi are abelian. For example, if we examine the series {id} ⊂ A3 ⊂ S3 , we see that A3 is solvable. On the other hand, S5 is not solvable, by Theorem 9.8. Lemma 21.16 Let F be a ﬁeld of characteristic zero and E be the splitting ﬁeld of xn − a over F with a ∈ F . Then G(E/F ) is a solvable group. Proof. First suppose that F contains all of its nth roots of unity. The roots √ √ √ of xn −a are n a, ω n a, . . . , ω n−1 n a, where ω is a primitive nth root of unity. If ζ is one of these roots, then distinct roots of xn − 1 are ζ, ωζ, . . . , ω n−1 ζ, and E = F (ζ). Since G(E/F ) permutes the roots xn − 1, the elements in G(E/F ) must be determined by their action on these roots. Let σ and τ be in G(E/F ) and suppose that σ(ζ) = ω i ζ and τ (ζ) = ω j ζ. If F contains the roots of unity, then στ (ζ) = σ(ω j ζ) = ω j σ(ζ) = ω ij ζ = ω i τ (ζ) = τ (ω i ζ) = τ σ(ζ). Therefore, στ = τ σ and G(E/F ) is abelian, and G(E/F ) is solvable. Suppose that F does not contain a primitive nth root of unity. Let ω be a generator of the cyclic group of the nth roots of unity. Let α be a zero of xn − a. Since α and ωα are both in the splitting ﬁeld of xn − a, ω = (ωα)/α is also in E. Let K = F (ω). Then F ⊂ K ⊂ E. Since K is the splitting ﬁeld of xn − 1, K is a normal extension of F . Any automorphism σ in G(F (ω)/F ) is determined by σ(ω). It must be the case that σ(ω) = ω i for some integer i since all of the zeros of xn − 1 are powers of ω. If τ (ω) = ω j is in G(F (ω)/F ), then στ (ω) = σ(ω j ) = [σ(ω)]j = ω ij = [τ (ω)]i = τ (ω i ) = τ σ(ω). Therefore, G(F (ω)/F ) is abelian. By the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory the series {id} ⊂ G(E/F (ω)) ⊂ G(E/F )

380

is a normal series. Since G(E/F (ω)) and G(E/F )/G(E/F (ω)) ∼ G(F (ω)/F ) = are both abelian, G(E/F ) is solvable. Lemma 21.17 Let F be a ﬁeld of characteristic zero and let E be a radical extension of F . Then there exists a normal radical extension K of F that contains E. Proof. Since E is a radical extension of F , there exist elements α1 , . . . , αr ∈ K and positive integers n1 , . . . , nr such that E = F (α1 , . . . , αr ),
n where α1 1 ∈ F and n αi i ∈ F (α1 , . . . , αi−1 )

for i = 2, . . . , r. Let f (x) = f1 (x) · · · fr (x), where fi is the minimal polynomial of αi over F , and let K be the splitting ﬁeld of K over F . Every root of f (x) in K is of the form σ(αi ), where σ ∈ G(K/F ). Therefore, for any σ ∈ G(K/F ), we have [σ(α1 )]n1 ∈ F and [σ(αi )]ni ∈ F (α1 , . . . , αi−1 ) for i = 2, . . . , r. Hence, if G(K/F ) = {σ1 = id, σ2 , . . . , σk }, then K = F (σ1 (αj )) is a radical extension of F . We will now prove the main theorem about solvability by radicals. Theorem 21.18 Let f (x) be in F [x], where charF = 0. If f (x) is solvable by radicals, then the Galois group of f (x) over F is solvable. Proof. Let K be a splitting ﬁeld of f (x) over F . Since f (x) is solvable, there exists an extension E of radicals F = F0 ⊂ F1 ⊂ · · · Fn = E. Since Fi is normal over Fi−1 , we know by Lemma 21.17 that E is a normal extension of each Fi . By the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, G(E/Fi ) is a normal subgroup of G(E/Fi−1 ). Therefore, we have a subnormal series of subgroups of G(E/F ): {id} ⊂ G(E/Fn−1 ) ⊂ · · · ⊂ G(E/F1 ) ⊂ G(E/F ). Again by the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, we know that G(E/Fi−1 )/G(E/Fi ) ∼ G(Fi /Fi−1 ). = By Lemma 21.16, G(Fi /Fi−1 ) is solvable; hence, G(E/F ) is also solvable. The converse of Theorem 21.18 is also true. For a proof, see any of the references at the end of this chapter.

Insolvability of the Quintic
We are now in a position to ﬁnd a ﬁfth-degree polynomial that is not solvable by radicals. We merely need to ﬁnd a polynomial whose Galois group is S5 . We begin by proving a lemma. Lemma 21.19 Any subgroup of Sn that contains a transposition and a cycle of length n must be all of Sn . Proof. Let G be a subgroup of Sn that contains a transposition σ and a cycle τ of length n. We may assume that σ = (12) and τ = (12 . . . n). Since (12)(1 . . . n) = (2 . . . n) and (2 . . . n)k (1, 2)(2 . . . n)−k = (1k), we can obtain all the transpositions of the form (1, n + 1 − k). However, these transpositions generate all transpositions in Sn , since (1j)(1i)(1j) = (ij). The transpositions generate Sn . Example 9. We will show that f (x) = x5 − 6x3 − 27x − 3 ∈ Q[x] is not solvable. We claim that the Galois group of f (x) over Q is S5 . By Eisenstein’s Criterion, f (x) is irreducible and, therefore, must be separable. The derivative of f (x) is f (x) = 5x4 − 18x2 − 27; hence, setting f (x) = 0 and solving, we ﬁnd that the only real roots of f (x) are x=± √ 6 6+9 . 5

Therefore, f (x) can have at most one maximum and one minimum. It is easy to show that f (x) changes sign between −3 and −2, between −2 and 0,

382

CHAPTER 21

GALOIS THEORY

and once again between 0 and 4 (Figure 21.4). Therefore, f (x) has exactly three distinct real roots. The remaining two roots of f (x) must be complex conjugates. Let K be the splitting ﬁeld of f (x). Since f (x) has ﬁve distinct roots in K and every automorphism of K ﬁxing Q is determined by the way it permutes the roots of f (x), we know that G(K/Q) is a subgroup of S5 . Since f is irreducible, there is an element in σ ∈ G(K/Q) such that σ(a) = b for two roots a and b of f (x). The automorphism of C that takes a + bi → a − bi leaves the real roots ﬁxed and interchanges the complex roots; consequently, G(K/Q) ⊂ S5 . By Lemma 21.19, S5 is generated by a transposition and an element of order 5; therefore, G(K/F ) must be all of S5 . By Theorem 9.8, S5 is not solvable. Consequently, f (x) cannot be solved by radicals.

The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra
It seems ﬁtting that the last theorem that we will state and prove is the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra. This theorem was ﬁrst proven by Gauss in his doctoral thesis. Prior to Gauss’s proof, mathematicians suspected that there might exist polynomials over the real and complex numbers having no solutions. The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra states that every polynomial over the complex numbers factors into distinct linear factors. Theorem 21.20 (Fundamental Theorem of Algebra) The ﬁeld of complex numbers is algebraically closed; that is, every polynomial in C[x] has a root in C. For our proof we shall assume two facts from calculus. We need the results that every polynomial of odd degree over R has a real root and that every positive real number has a square root. Proof. Suppose that E is a proper ﬁnite ﬁeld extension of the complex numbers. Since any ﬁnite extension of a ﬁeld of characteristic zero is a simple extension, there exists an α ∈ E such that E = C(α) with α the root of an irreducible polynomial f (x) in C[x]. The splitting ﬁeld L of f (x) is a ﬁnite normal separable extension of C that contains E. We must show that it is impossible for L to be a proper extension of C. Suppose that L is a proper extension of C. Since L is the splitting ﬁeld of f (x)(x2 + 1) over R, L is a ﬁnite normal separable extension of R. Let K be the ﬁxed ﬁeld of a Sylow 2-subgroup G of G(L/R). Then L ⊃ K ⊃ R and |G(L/K)| = [L : K]. Since [L : R] = [L : K][K : R], we know that

EXERCISES

383

[K : R] must be odd. Consequently, K = R(β) with β having a minimal polynomial f (x) of odd degree. Therefore, K = R. We now know that G(L/R) must be a 2-group. It follows that G(L/C) is a 2-group. We have assumed that L = C; therefore, |G(L/C)| ≥ 2. By the ﬁrst Sylow Theorem and the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, there exists a subgroup G of G(L/C) of index 2 and a ﬁeld E ﬁxed elementwise by G. Then [E : C] = 2 and there exists an element γ ∈ E with minimal √ polynomial x2 +bx+c in C[x]. This polynomial has roots (−b± b2 − 4c )/2 that are in C, since b2 − 4c is in C. This is impossible; hence, L = C. Although our proof was strictly algebraic, we were forced to rely on results from calculus. It is necessary to assume the completeness axiom from analysis to show that every polynomial of odd degree has a real root and that every positive real number has a square root. It seems that there is no possible way to avoid this diﬃculty and formulate a purely algebraic argument. It is somewhat amazing that there are several elegant proofs of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra that use complex analysis. It is also interesting to note that we can obtain a proof of such an important theorem from two very diﬀerent ﬁelds of mathematics.

1. S(1) : [1(1 + 1)(2(1) + 1)]/6 = 1 = 12 is true. Assume S(k) : 12 + 22 + · · · + k 2 = [k(k + 1)(2k + 1)]/6 is true. Then 12 + 22 + · · · + k 2 + (k + 1)2 = [k(k + 1)(2k + 1)]/6 + (k + 1)2 = [(k + 1)((k + 1) + 1)(2(k + 1) + 1)]/6, so S(k + 1) is true. Thus S(n) is true for all positive integers n. 3. S(4) : 4! = 24 > 16 = 24 is true. Assume S(k) : k! > 2k is true. Then (k + 1)! = k!(k + 1) > 2k · 2 = 2k+1 , so S(k + 1) is true. Thus S(n) is true for all positive integers n. 8. Look at the proof in Example 3. 11. S(0) : (1 + x)0 − 1 = 0 ≥ 0 = 0 · x is true. Assume S(k) : (1 + x)k − 1 ≥ kx is true.

H ∩K is normal in both H and K since it has index 2 in both groups. Hence, N (H ∩K) contains both H and K. Therefore, |N (H ∩K)| must be a multiple of 32 greater than 1 and still divide 96, so N (H ∩ K) = G. 8. G has a Sylow q-subgroup of order q 2 . Since the number of such subgroups is congruent to 1 modulo q and divides p2 q 2 , there must be either 1, p, or p2 Sylow q-subgroups. Since q | p2 − 1 = (p − 1)(p + 1), there can be only one Sylow q-subgroup, say Q. Similarly, we can show that there is a single Sylow p-subgroup P . Every element in Q other than the identity has order q or q 2 , so P ∩ Q = {e}. Now show that hk = kh for h ∈ P and k ∈ Q. Deduce that G = P × Q is abelian. 10. False. 17. If G is abelian, then G is cyclic, since |G| = 3 · 5 · 17. Now look at Example 5. 23. Deﬁne a mapping between the right cosets of N (H) in G and the conjugates of H in G by N (H)g → g −1 Hg.

Version 1.2, November 2002 Copyright c 2000,2001,2002 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble
The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and useful document “free” in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the eﬀective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modiﬁcations made by others. This License is a kind of “copyleft”, which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software. We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

1. Applicability And Deﬁnitions
This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The “Document”,

406

GFDL LICENSE

407

below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as “you”. You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law. A “Modiﬁed Version” of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modiﬁcations and/or translated into another language. A “Secondary Section” is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document’s overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them. The “Invariant Sections” are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not ﬁt the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none. The “Cover Texts” are certain short passages of text that are listed, as FrontCover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words. A “Transparent” copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose speciﬁcation is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent ﬁle format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modiﬁcation by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not “Transparent” is called “Opaque”. Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modiﬁcation. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only. The “Title Page” means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to

408

GFDL LICENSE

appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, “Title Page” means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work’s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text. A section “Entitled XYZ” means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a speciﬁc section name mentioned below, such as “Acknowledgements”, “Dedications”, “Endorsements”, or “History”.) To “Preserve the Title” of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section “Entitled XYZ” according to this deﬁnition. The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no eﬀect on the meaning of this License.

2. Verbatim Copying
You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3. You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies.

3. Copying In Quantity
If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document’s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects. If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to ﬁt legibly, you should put the ﬁrst ones listed (as many as ﬁt reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.

GFDL LICENSE

409

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public. It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

4. Modiﬁcations
You may copy and distribute a Modiﬁed Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modiﬁed Version under precisely this License, with the Modiﬁed Version ﬁlling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modiﬁcation of the Modiﬁed Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modiﬁed Version: A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission. B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modiﬁcations in the Modiﬁed Version, together with at least ﬁve of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than ﬁve), unless they release you from this requirement. C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modiﬁed Version, as the publisher. D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document. E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modiﬁcations adjacent to the other copyright notices. F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modiﬁed Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below. G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document’s license notice.

410
H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

GFDL LICENSE

I. Preserve the section Entitled “History”, Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modiﬁed Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled “History” in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modiﬁed Version as stated in the previous sentence. J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the “History” section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission. K. For any section Entitled “Acknowledgements” or “Dedications”, Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein. L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles. M. Delete any section Entitled “Endorsements”. Such a section may not be included in the Modiﬁed Version. N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled “Endorsements” or to conﬂict in title with any Invariant Section. O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers. If the Modiﬁed Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modiﬁed Version’s license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles. You may add a section Entitled “Endorsements”, provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modiﬁed Version by various parties–for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative deﬁnition of a standard. You may add a passage of up to ﬁve words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modiﬁed Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

GFDL LICENSE

411

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modiﬁed Version.

5. Combining Documents
You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms deﬁned in section 4 above for modiﬁed versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodiﬁed, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers. The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but diﬀerent contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work. In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled “History” in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled “History”; likewise combine any sections Entitled “Acknowledgements”, and any sections Entitled “Dedications”. You must delete all sections Entitled “Endorsements”.

6. Collections Of Documents
You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects. You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.

7. Aggregation With Independent Works
A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not ap-

412

GFDL LICENSE

ply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document. If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document’s Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.

8. Translation
Translation is considered a kind of modiﬁcation, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail. If a section in the Document is Entitled “Acknowledgements”, “Dedications”, or “History”, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title.

9. Termination
You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

10. Future Revisions Of This License
The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may diﬀer in detail to address new problems or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/. Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document speciﬁes that a particular numbered version of this License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions

GFDL LICENSE

413
